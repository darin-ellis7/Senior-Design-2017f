Simpson and Patty Hearst trials highlighted the program at the Welty Gala, the annual fundraiser Mississippi University for Women hosts every year to raise money for scholarships.\n\nThe majority of Toobin\'s nearly hour-long speech focused on the Supreme Court and how its political makeup has changed over the last 50 years. He opened the floor for questions near the end of the night, which is when one student asked him his least favorite of President Donald Trump\'s decisions.\n\nFor Toobin, it was Trump\'s demand to National Football League that athletes who kneel during the national anthem be fired.\n\n\"I want to talk about the national anthem,\" Toobin said. \"...The president is saying that, you know, you better stand up during the national anthem ... or get rid of those SOBs if they don\'t stand up. Well in 1943, the Supreme Court had a case called Barnette v. West Virginia Board of Education. That was a case about a school child, a Jehovah\'s Witness, whose religion required him not to salute the flag.\"\n\nToobin read an excerpt from the court\'s majority decision.\n\n\"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein,\" Toobin read. \"If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.\"\n\n\'A political body\'\n\nWhile it was Toobin\'s favorite decision of any Supreme Court justices have written -- and the only one to receive a round of applause from the crowd -- it was far from the only case Toobin touched on in his speech.\n\nHe mentioned Loving v. Virginia in 1967, which legalized interracial marriage, Roe v. Wade in 1973, Bush v. Gore in 2000 and plenty of others, talking about the influence each case had on American culture and how individual justices steered the court\'s decisions.\n\n\"My view is that the Supreme Court is a deeply political body and one whose decisions reverberate through many people\'s every-day lives,\" Toobin said during an interview with the press before the gala. \"But because there\'s no television in the courtrooms, people tend to forget how important it is and what the justices are like behind the scenes. So I like to talk about the significance of the Supreme Court in contemporary politics.\"\n\nMedia and politics\n\nStill, Toobin didn\'t shy away from politics and journalism during question and answer sessions with reporters, MUW students and gala audience members. His topics ranged from Trump\'s Tweets to what it\'s like covering national stories.\n\n\"We\'re at a moment when news seems very politicized,\" he said. \"Between cable news and the internet, and certainly your Facebook feed and Twitter, you can curate what kind of news you get in a way that\'s very different from when your parents were growing up -- basically everyone in the whole country watched Walter Cronkite.\n\n\"(Now) the news media is very atomized and it\'s become atomized by politics,\" he added. \"And I don\'t think that\'s necessarily a bad thing because people can choose the news they want.\"\n\nHe said he doesn\'t even mind Trump\'s use of Twitter, which he takes as statements of government policy.\n\n\"I like the fact that we have this unmediated access to what a president is thinking,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is that sometimes he\'s Tweeting things that are just not true or outrageous like that NBC should have its license taken away ... because the president doesn\'t like what they\'re broadcasting,\" he added.\n\n\'Be a good storyteller\'\n\nToobin\'s advice to students: learn to write well and quickly. More broadly, know that even as methods of spreading news and telling stories change, the audience for those stories will always be there.\n\n\"I think it\'s important to be a good storyteller and to be able to keep people interested in whatever you\'re telling them,\" he said. \"...It\'s true that the forms of distribution are different, but good storyelling -- whether it\'s using video, audio, words -- will always have an audience.\"\n\nThere\'s nothing like being in the middle of a big story, Toobin said.\n\n\"My favorite part is sort of feeling like you\'re at the center of the universe, feeling like everybody wants to know what you know,\" he said. \"...You just feel like people just can\'t wait to hear what you have to say or read what you have to write.\"', 'Welty Gala: Toobin touches on Supreme Court, Trump tweets and journalism'),

These transcripts are lightly edited and may contain errors. For the definitive record, consult the podcast.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.\n\n\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Hi, and welcome to Amicus, Slate’s podcast about the Supreme Court and the courts in the law. I’m Dahlia Lithwick, and I cover the courts for Slate. This was another busy week at the U.S. Supreme Court, where, despite the fact that the travel ban lawsuit was not argued and then dismissed as moot, which is clearly a win for Donald Trump, the justices heard arguments over whether corporations are liable under the Alien Tort Statute and the scope of the Clean Water Act. But for soap opera fans, there was a fair amount of giggly coverage about the degree to which the court’s youngest justice, Neil Gorsuch, maybe needs to spend a little time in the naughty chair for what seems to be a pattern of cutting off his colleagues and saying things smugly at them.\n\nWe wanted to pan back a little bit this week and talk about the federal judiciary, in part because I think this might be the single-most-unremarked win of the Trump era, and it’s a win that will have consequences that last for decades. Donald Trump took office with a whole mess of vacancies, and we wanted to talk to somebody who could explain to us how Trump is, under the radar, transforming the federal bench. This seems like eye-glazing inside-baseball stuff, but it really isn’t.\n\nI’m so delighted that my guest this week is Kristen Clarke. She’s president and executive director of the national Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. You can call it the Lawyers’ Committee. She’s also one of the sharpest court watchers in the country. Welcome, Kristen, to Amicus.\n\nKristen Clarke: Oh, thank you so much for having me.\n\nLithwick: Did anything I just said strike you as wrong? I mean, is it true? Am I right that, under the day-to-day radar of explosive stories, there is this absolute relentless drumbeat of federal judicial appointments that are quite dramatic, even though they’re not dramatic?\n\nClarke: This is a huge issue that many people are not paying attention to, but almost a crisis-level issue if you think about the number of vacancies that exist across our federal court system right now. There are about 150 federal court vacancies. This matters so much when you think about the kinds of cases and controversies that are handled in our nation’s federal courts.\n\nThe Muslim ban case is a prime example. This is one of the most horrendous and discriminatory actions that we have seen by this administration. The use of an executive order to prohibit people from entering the country from predominantly Muslim nations has set off a firestorm of controversy. Our organization, the Lawyers’ Committee, and a number of other groups, have brought challenges in the courts challenging the Muslim ban. There are a range of other actions that this administration actioned that have wound up in the courts.\n\nThis president, President Trump, will get to name dozens of nominees to many vacant courts around the country. It’s an issue that we have to pay attention to because, at the end of the day, Americans deserve judges who will handle and treat the cases that come before them fairly and with independence.\n\nWhat we’ve seen so far from this president suggests that he’s very focused on naming young, radical ideologues to the courts, people who are far outside the mainstream, people who I fear may not be able to fairly interpret and apply the law, and many people who will bring with them a partisan agenda that they seek to execute while on the bench. This is an issue that impacts all Americans, and one that we have to pay close attention to.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, before we get started too deep in the federal judiciary, talk a little bit about Neil Gorsuch. I mentioned in the intro there’s been a lot of muttering about him this week. You testified at his confirmation hearing. Can you talk a little bit about what you witnessed in the last couple of months?\n\nClarke: Well, one, the opportunity to testify at his confirmation hearing truly, for me, reinforced just how important these confirmation hearings are. I was disturbed at the pace of those hearings. Some of the senators were deeply engaged in rigorously reviewing and examining his record, understand the kind of justice he would be on the Supreme Court. Others were very tuned out. I think that the confirmation process is an important one, and I hope that as we move forward with nominations to the district and circuit courts, we’ll have a Senate that is deeply engaged in doing its job on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOne of the concerns that I raised during the confirmation hearing were real questions about whether Judge Gorsuch had and would have the ability to fairly interpret and apply federal civil rights laws, given some of the cases that he handled on criminal justice and other issues while on the circuit court. So far, I think that those concerns have indeed proved to be valid. This is our first full term with Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. He started in the midst of the last term, but already we’re seeing a lot of indications that he is somebody who is like Justice Scalia. He’s somebody who aligns closely with Justice Scalia.\n\nThis, I think, raises real questions about the incredibly important civil rights cases on the court’s docket this term, cases concerning LGBT equality, partisan gerrymandering, vote purges, and other issues, and truly underscores how important it is when we think about our federal district and circuit courts that we have judges who don’t bring with them an agenda, but instead are judges who can truly be independent in applying the law.\n\nLithwick: It’s worth saying that all the attention that we put on the U.S. Supreme Court, and it’s terrifically important, and Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch, most of us know about that, but let’s be honest and recognize that the courts of appeals are actually the last stop for about 95 percent of the federal cases. The court takes, what, 100, less, cases a year. Actually, the determinant of what the law is in this country, for the most part, is not the Supreme Court; it’s the federal appellate bench, correct?\n\nClarke: That’s true. The Supreme Court does overshadow the federal district courts and the federal appeals courts, but many, the vast majority of cases and controversies, end up being resolved by judges who sit on those courts. It’s why we’ve got to care about the 150 or so vacancies that are out there and that President Trump is actively working to fill right now.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, before we move forward with the actual numbers, because they’re pretty startling, I do want to push back and say what we’re going to hear in response to what you’re saying is, “Look, this is a game both sides can play,” and that when Obama came into office, he put radical ideologues from the left on the court, that, “Well, you’re saying that the Republicans killed the filibuster, but actually the Democrats killed the filibuster.” Bork, Bork, Bork, Bork all the way down. Can you help me understand, if I want to think about this in a neutral and fair fashion, why what Trump is doing right now is any different from what Republicans would say Obama did last go-round?\n\nClarke: Yeah. I guess I would disagree with that characterization. I think that President Obama was very mindful of finding judges who could be fair and independent and, at the end of the day, could draw some margin of bipartisan support.\n\nOne of the long-standing traditions that has been used in the judicial nomination process is the use of blue slips. These are literally blue pieces of paper that, by tradition, not by Senate role, must be returned to the Senate judiciary committee by the home state senators for a nominee, the idea being that senators would best know the judges who were being nominated, or the individuals who are being nominated, to the bench from their respective states.\n\nDuring President Obama’s term, you had folks like Senator Mitch McConnell who urged, who pleaded with President Obama to not abandon the blue slip tradition, and they didn’t. At that time, Senator Patrick Leahy led the judiciary committee, and the blue slip tradition process was adhered to and followed consistently and helped ensure that fair and independent judges would get through the process.\n\nAbout 18 of President Obama’s judicial nominees were not able to proceed, but many others were. I think that the blue slip tradition helps ensure that judges are properly vetted and that judges who fall within the mainstream are the ones who ultimately make it onto the bench and make it to this lifetime-appointed position.\n\nLithwick: Underneath what you’re describing is, again, this is a century-old, seemingly arcane Senate tradition, this gentlemen’s club effort to do something other than shear power when looking at the federal judiciary, but underneath that, there is ... This week, Mitch McConnell told the Weekly Standard on Tuesday that, “We’re done.” He’s doing away with blue slips. They’re just nothing. It’s a symbolic gesture. From now on, they’re immaterial.\n\nHis spokesman seems to have walked that back a little bit on Wednesday. I think that somewhere in the Senate Republican land, there is a conversation about whether to, in fact, do away with blue slips.\n\nThis is not a rule; this is a norm. This is just a courtesy. I imagine that in much the same way that we did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees a few months ago, we can just do away with the blue slip, and there’s not much that Democrats can do to push back, right?\n\nClarke: What’s unfortunate, we shouldn’t be so quick to abandon long-standing rules and traditions that have governed how our Congress operates. When we’re talking about judges who enjoy lifetime appointments, lifetime tenure, we should have close and careful bidding.\n\nOne of the things that I think we sometimes do is we don’t explain fully how the blue slip tradition process works. When we hear talk of Senator McConnell kind of quick to walk away from the courtesy, there may be some people who think, “Oh, yeah. It’s just a courtesy.” But, again, this is a long-standing practice that empowers every senator, irrespective of their party, to help determine which judges get confirmed for local judgeships in their states. It’s a final check to ensure that the courts reflect the actual communities that they serve. It’s one way to filter out people who may just fall too far outside the mainstream.\n\nI think we want a process where senators are working to find consensus around judicial nominees. We want judicial nominees who can enjoy some degree or some level of bipartisan support. To me, it’s more than a courtesy. It truly is an important tradition and one that senators should not be quick to turn their back on.\n\nLithwick: I think I would add to what you’re saying, Kristen, that there are states that have tried to pick their way through what tends to be this intractable fight about judges by creating bipartisan commissions that actually work fairly well to do what you’re saying, which is we get a bunch of people across the aisle, we have them hash out who they could both compromise on.\n\nI think one of the blue slips that’s at issue right now, Senator Merkley has said, “We have a commission here,” and Trump is just ignoring a commission that has picked Republicans and Democrats and seems to be taking the temperature down. That’s a piece of it, too. It’s not just home state senators, but, in some sense, home state senators trying to respect systems that their states have set up to de-escalate what looks like mutually assured destruction, right?\n\nClarke: That’s right. When we take a step back and think about what’s happening further, the other devastating development this past year was the White House ending the use of the American Bar Association’s role in vetting judges.\n\nFor many years, the ABA has played a critical role in producing reports that help ensure that judicial nominees, or explain whether judicial nominees, meet some real basic criteria. Even when they reviewed the record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, they gave Judge Gorsuch the Bar Association’s highest rating, but, nonetheless, the White House has decided to cut them out of the vetting process, and instead what we see is that they’re now working and consulting closely with groups like the Federalist Society to identify nominees.\n\nThe ABA is one of our country’s oldest and largest membership groups. It represents lawyers of all political stripes on the left and on the right, and the reports that they have been produced have been incredibly valuable in vetting nominees and helping the public understand whether or not nominees meet basic threshold criteria.\n\nIn so many respects, we’re seeing traditions thrown out the window. I think all of this presented a dangerous scenario in terms of thinking about the transformation of the courts that could happen in the road ahead.\n\nLithwick: Let’s talk about the actual numbers, because I think this is maybe a way to measure the difference between Trump and the people who’ve come before. As you said, he came on with about 150 vacancies. He’s already named 60 people, I think, for federal judgeships, seven have been confirmed. No president before Donald Trump had named even three judges in the first six months. He’s named nine.\n\nThis is going to more than double the number of federal judges picked by anyone in their first year. The pace, the breakneck pace, is in such contrast to President Obama, who, I think it’s fair to say, was quite slow to start up his judicial-nominations machinery. Is this just one of those “make hay while the sun shines” things where everybody agrees that the one thing we can do is fundamentally transform the courts; let’s do it superfast while no one’s looking?\n\nClarke: There appears to be a real strategy under way. What they’re doing right now is working on filling the open vacancies in states where you have two Republican senators, and presumably where you’ll have no issue in terms of securing two blue slips for a potential nominee. They’re also lining up multiple nominees on the same day, which prevents the public from getting a real opportunity to learn and understand who these nominees are and really prevents the senators from doing their job in reviewing the nominees that come before them.\n\nI was struck, for example, by the fact that they scheduled the hearing of Eric Dreiband, the nominee to lead the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, on the same day that they were considering several other judicial nominees. They are indeed racing forward at lightning speed. They’ve got a strategy in place in terms of the states where they are starting. As a result, we’re seeing a lot of nominees who are moving through the pipeline, who bring with them some really frightening records.\n\nAmong them are folks like John Bush, who was nominated for a vacancy in the 6th Circuit. He’s out of Kentucky. He’s somebody who’s, in his writing, he’s compared slavery and abortion and described these two events as two tragedies in our country. He failed to disclose on a questionnaire that’s reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee the fact that he belongs to a social club in Louisville, Kentucky, that had a long history of excluding African Americans, women, and Jews.\n\nThere are also nominees such as Damien Schiff. He’s somebody who drew headlines when he described Supreme Court Justice Kennedy as “a judicial prostitute.” He’s somebody who also has troubling views on LGBT issues. He once criticized the school district for teaching that homosexual families are the moral equivalent of heterosexual families, arguing that that, in his view, remains an open question.\n\nThese are people who I think should be carefully and closely scrutinized so we can understand whether, if placed on the bench, they can have the capacity to fairly interpret and apply the law and fairly interpret and apply federal civil rights laws. But because of the fast pace at which all of this is moving, we’re seeing some real radical nominees advancing through the nominations process.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, you just mentioned Damien Schiff, you mentioned John Bush. I guess I would add to the pile Jeff Mateer. He’s now been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. He’s described transgender children as “part of Satan’s plan.” You’re describing—I’m describing bloggers. These are not people who have what one would consider as judicial background and temperament. These are people who, as far as I can tell, write and speak polemical screeds.\n\nIn that sense, what I want to ask you is what do we make of the fact that then they come up for their hearings and say things like, “Oh, you can’t put any weight into stuff I said or wrote. I was just being mean. Now I’m going to put on a judicial robe and become this transcendent visionary of neutral legal application”?\n\nI mean that seems to have been the pattern we saw with Schiff and with Bush in their hearings. It seems as though they’re trying to say, “Even if you question me closely on my paper trail, it doesn’t matter because something magic will happen when I become a judge, and I’ll suddenly be a different guy.” How do you even answer that kind of claim?\n\nClarke: Well, the words that people utter, the writings that people have published, all of these things matter and inform and shape the record that nominees bring to them when they go before the Senate for review. I think it’s a mistake to turn a blind eye to those things. They lend insight into the kind of judge that they will be when they put on that black robe. It provides some insight into their likely judicial philosophy. They can help the Senate and the public understand whether or not they truly are independent.\n\nAt the end the day, we want judges who won’t bring with them preconceived views about the facts that come before them, preconceived notions about what the law requires. You want judges who really are independent. It’s not something that every American has the capacity to do, but you really have to be able to look at the facts that come before you and make decisions that are based on the facts within the four corners of the documents and the testimony presented to the court.\n\nI worry that a lot of these radical individuals with fringe views don’t have that capacity and are really making their way onto the bench to advance a political agenda, one that we’ve seen espoused in their statements and their writings prior to being nominated.\n\nLithwick: I want to give you a chance to respond to, again, the proposition that, “Well, but Barack Obama put up radical—he put up radical women on the D.C. Circuit. He flipped the 4th Circuit to the extent that Donald Trump lost the travel ban. There’s no difference, that this is just what presidents get to do.” What’s the answer? Is this a difference of kind of degree, of scale, or is it just that both teams play this way?\n\nClarke: Well, the one thing that I think President Obama did was address the fact that there are certain minority groups that have been long unrepresented on our nation’s court. He did a great job, I think, in advancing judicial diversity. He named and ultimately appointed record numbers of African Americans, Latinos, women, and Asian Americans to the bench, to the extent that people equate diversity with the notion of being radical.\n\nI guess I would dismiss that notion. I think that he has helped to balance out the courts and address the collective failure of presidents before him, ensuring that our courts reflect the growing diversity of our nation. At the end of the day, if we want the public to have confidence in the work of our courts and in the rulings issued by our courts, we want to have courts that reflect our nation and reflect the diversity of the communities in which they fit.\n\nI think President Obama was somebody who was truly sensitized to the work that needed to be done to close those gaps. If that’s being radical, I guess he was radical. I’m glad that he was, because what we’re seeing now is essentially the whitening of the courts. President Trump has made clear that diversity is not at all a priority for him. We’ve not seen many women on his slate of nominees, much less people of color. I am deeply concerned about the fact that we’re at a moment where we are absolutely turning the clock back.\n\nLithwick: To which I would add, these are young nominees. These are significantly younger. There are folks who are being tapped who are in their 30s and 40s, so we’re not talking about a 20-year tenure on the federal bench. We can be talking about a 40-year tenure. That also makes a difference over time.\n\nKristen, before I let you go, I want to give you a chance to answer the question that I think about, and we’ve thought a lot about this on the show, which is why is it that the Republicans have been so energized around issues of the court, not just the Supreme Court, but, as you said, the lower courts? Democrats have really had a hard time connecting the dots between a presidential election, a Supreme Court vacancy, elderly judges at the Supreme Court who need to be replaced, and this issue of the federal bench really being transformed before our eyes. Democrats seem to have somehow hit snooze on this.\n\nClarke: I think that right now there’s a lot of noise out there, and the public is deeply focused on the actions that we see every day from this administration. Every day we’re seeing reversal on policies from the Obama era. We’re seeing new executive orders that are turning the clock back on progress. We’re seeing white supremacists marching in the streets who don’t seem to be fully confronted by this administration or the Justice Department.\n\nThose are the issues that I think have really consumed national dialogue and attention, but it’s important to remember that many of the dangerous actions that have been undertaken by this administration are resulting in litigation by civil rights groups like the Lawyers’ Committee and others. These are cases that are being heard often and tried before our federal courts.\n\nWe’re talking about cases concerning the Muslim ban, concerning sanctuary cities and the threats to take away funding from sanctuary cities, battles that are brewing over voting rights. Last week, we saw the elimination of the contraceptive mandate. All of these issues that are front and center for the public actually have litigation that are coming right behind it, which is why we can’t ignore what’s happening with respect to the transformation of our courts.\n\nOne hundred and fifty vacancies, or somewhere thereabout. That’s a lot of individuals who ultimately will enjoy lifetime appointment and who can have impacts that we’ll feel for generations. We’re watching closely to see who these nominees are, we’re watching closely at the fact that we’re turning the clock back when it comes to diversity, and urge the public to be engaged in this process.\n\nAt the end of the day, the senators do have a job. They do have an obligation and a constitutional responsibility to fully and fairly evaluate these judicial nominees, and the public should speak up, speak out, and reach out to their senators when they learn about nominees that fall too far outside the mainstream.\n\nLithwick: Kristen Clarke is president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the country’s most important national civil rights organizations. She watches the judicial branch closely, and we need to, as well. Kristen, it was a pleasure having you on Amicus this week.\n\nClarke: Thank you for having me.', 'How Donald Trump Is Filling the Numerous Vacancies on the Federal Bench'),

The owners of Valley Guns & Ammo complied with federal and state regulations, received a local zoning variance, and obtained the conditional use permit they needed to open.\n\nBut a local homeowners’ association filed an appeal with the county Board of Supervisors, contending that the store violated a county ordinance that banned any gun store within 500 feet of a residentially zoned area, a school or day care center, another gun store, or a liquor store.

The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that there are “ancillary rights necessary to the realization of the core right to possess a firearm for self-defense,” but the Supreme Court has been vague about what restrictions are permissible.\n\nThe justices owe the nation more clarity.

Mahony', '2017-10-23', 'In a case that implicates free speech, fighting words and the coarsening of public discourse, state prosecutors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a 25-day jail term on a Rockville woman convicted of upsetting public order by flinging disgustingly vile insults at a grocery store manager.\n\nThe prosecutors want the court to reverse the state Supreme Court, which ruled in July that Nina Baccala was protected by constitutional free speech guarantees when she blasted a Stop N Shop night manager with a string of vulgarities punctuated with what the state justices called “one or more of the most vulgar terms known in our lexicon to refer to (the female) gender.”\n\nBaccala was convicted of breach of the peace for using “fighting words,” a narrow category of speech that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 80 years ago is not protected by the First Amendment because it is likely to cause the person being addressed to retaliate quickly and violently.\n\nState prosecutors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the appeal.\n\nThe nation’s high court gets thousands of such requests a year and turns most aside. The court could announce later this year whether it will take the case.\n\nThe evidence presented against Baccala, 45, showed that she called the Stop N Shop in Vernon during the evening hours four years ago to announce that she would be arriving to pick up a Western Union money transfer. Assistant store manager Tara Freeman told her the store wasn’t processing transfers because the customer service desk was closed.\n\nBaccala arrived anyway. She was told again that transfer service was unavailable and directed a verbal tirade at Freeman that could be heard by other store employees and customers. Freeman retained her composure and, eventually, said “have a good night,” and Baccala left the store.\n\nShe was later arrested and convicted.\n\nThe state Supreme Court reversed. Writing for the majority, Justice Andrew McDonald said courts must consider the context of confrontations before labeling speech as fighting words. The decision said that managers of large stores are similar to police officers in that they have learned through training or experience not to react violently to vitriolic insults.\n\n“Store managers are routinely confronted by disappointed, frustrated customers who express themselves in angry terms, although not always as crude as those used by (Baccala),” the court said.\n\nThe state court also wrote that the coarsening of everyday language makes it less likely that people will respond violently to language because “public sensitivities have been dulled to some extent by the devolution of discourse.”\n\nAssistant State’s Attorney Mitchell Brody, who has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case, wrote in the state’s papers that the Connecticut justices have improperly shrunk the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of unprotected speech by creating a new classification of citizen who can be berated without consequence.\n\nBrody also argued that “a general coarsening of discourse may provoke rather than diminish violent responses.“\n\n“This Court has never considered the question of whether the prevalence of degrading language generally hardens ordinary citizens to its vulgarity or, instead, sensitizes them, putting them on edge and rendering them prone to violent retaliation when they are personally targeted,” he wrote.\n\nHe said in an interview that prosecutors are pressing an appeal because of the numbers of cases of verbal abuse in the state’s court dockets.\n\n“We have a case right now we’ve filed in the appellate court in which someone used racial language against a parking lot officer and there are many more,” Brody said. “It seems that the boundaries are starting to disappear. The reason we are prosecuting this stuff is because it is bubbling up and the line between civilized and uncivilized behavior has really eroded. It’s not as if we are out there to sort of despoil the First Amendment.”\n\nAttorney John L. Cordiani Jr., representing Baccala, filed papers Monday arguing that the state Supreme Court settled the case properly when it decided that, in certain contexts, there is no likelihood that violent language will provoke a physically violent reaction.\n\n“Absent truly extraordinary words, a police officer is not likely to hit an irate detainee who is expressing his anger purely verbally,” Cordiani wrote in his papers to the nation’s high court. “A school teacher will probably not react violently to a misbehaving student. In a theatrical production or stand-up comedians are unlikely to physical retaliate against boorish hecklers. And most importantly for the purposes of this case, the manager of a large grocery store is not likely to attack a disgruntled customer in retaliation for profane name-calling.”', 'State Asks US Supreme Court To Take Case Involving Abusive Language'),

I got a four-year scholarship because of basketball, and I did well in college, and the rest is history,” said Harper, 74. “Here’s a white man who took an interest in an inner-city kid. He put me on the right path. He believed in me, and he believed in my ability.”\n\nWhen Harper went back to school to get his master’s degree, he again had a professor who took an interest. He said it has been an accumulation of experiences that shaped his belief and commitment to diversity and inclusion, starting from when he was just a young man playing basketball.\n\n“When I hear people trying to divide based on race, that runs counter to my experience. So I’m determined to try to make a difference,” he said. “So when I see what’s happening on a national level, it pains me. It pains me that we’re tearing people apart based on their ethnicity, based on the color of their skin, based on their religion. So I’ve been committed to fight against that, and I’ve dedicated my life to try to pull people together.”\n\nIn a keynote address given Monday that kicked off the Connecticut judicial branch’s Diversity Week, Harper said building a culture of inclusion is an enduring challenge for both the nation and the state judicial branch, pointing to the violence at the Aug. 12 demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, as an example.\n\nHeld by the judicial branch’s Advisory Committee on Cultural Competency, the event was part of an effort to build a better workplace environment for its employees and to better serve the public, said Supreme Court Justice Richard Robinson, who also serves as the committee’s chairman.\n\n“Culture makes a difference, how people are treated makes a difference, and some people felt they weren’t being treated equally when they came to the judicial branch. Now just imagine, the only reason we have power is because people trust us, and if people start to distrust us, then we don’t have power,” said Robinson. “People stop listening to our rulings, our edicts, people stop believing the system is fair for them, and so they willingly give us their power, they willingly give us this trust. This is our way of respecting that, and of showing the public we really do care about them as individuals, regardless of race, creed, color, gender, sexuality, all those things.”\n\nThe week-long event features speakers who will talk about a range of topics from veterans’ issues to race relations and religious issues.\n\n“Our country, our power, our beauty is in our diversity and we need to embrace that and understand that,” Robinson said.\n\nWhile Harper said he is not “naive” enough to believe “hardened bigots” can be reasoned with or have their minds changed, he said he does believe now is the time for people “of good will, who believe in justice and equality for all” to engage in a discussion among people of all races, faiths and ethnicities. He said if America is truly going to be a diverse and inclusive society, people need to appreciate human and cultural differences.\n\nHowever, he doesn’t think it should take “catastrophic” natural disasters or mass murder to make people realize their common humanity. Quoting the words of former President Jimmy Carter, Harper said, “‘We are, of course, a nation of differences. Those differences don’t make us weak. They’re the source of our strength.’”\n\nOne of the challenges Harper said he believes the country faces is its refusal to accept the reality of its changing demographic as the population becomes more diverse and white Americans will eventually become a minority. As the country moves toward a future where “so-called minorities” will be the majority, he said the nation as well as the state’s judicial branch must “double down” its efforts to advance diversity.\n\nWhile Connecticut’s judicial system has made significant strides, the organization needs to continue to build on its progress by recognizing that its greatest asset is its employees, he said. Harper said he wants to create an environment in which all minorities are adequately represented, believing the judicial system should mirror the population it serves.\n\n“For, if it does not, then that growing majority of our diverse work force will lose faith and confidence in the branch’s efforts to build a culture of inclusion. ... I believe it is equally vital that we are perceived as worthy of the faith and confidence reposed in us by the individuals and greater society that we serve,” Harper said.\n\nHe concluded that members of the state’s judicial branch have an opportunity to make a difference, “to be a voice that works toward and demands diversity,” explaining to do otherwise would run counter to its mission to provide “justice for all.”\n\njessica.lerner@hearstmediact.com; @jesslerner on Twitter', 'New Haven\'s Lubbie Harper Jr., retired Supreme Court justice, makes call for diversity in justice');

Samsung lawsuit is getting a big \"reset,\" thanks to last year\'s Supreme Court ruling on design patents.\n\nThe long-running litigation rollercoaster has included so many turns it\'s hard to keep track. The case was filed in 2011 and went to a 2012 jury trial, which resulted in a blockbuster verdict of more than $1 billion. Post-trial damage motions whittled that down, and then there was a 2013 damages re-trial in front of a separate jury. An appeals court kicked out trademark-related damages altogether.\n\nFurther Reading Samsung victorious at Supreme Court fight with 8-0 opinion against Apple Meanwhile, a whole separate case moved forward in which Apple sued over a new generation of Samsung products. That lawsuit went to a jury trial in 2014 and resulted in a $120 million verdict, far less than the $2 billion Apple was seeking. That verdict was thrown out on appeal, then reinstated on a subsequent appeal. So that one appears to stand.\n\nBut back to that first case. After a lot of back and forth, Samsung agreed to make a payment of $548 million, but the Korean giant didn\'t give up its right to appeal. In a landmark case over design patents, the US Supreme Court said that the damages had been done all wrong—but the justices gave little guidance as to how they should be done. The high court threw out $399 million of the damages Apple had won.\n\nYesterday, US District Judge Lucy Koh published a 35-page order (PDF) explaining her criteria for the new trial. A scheduling hearing will take place later this week. There are two types of patents: design patents cover the way something looks, while utility patents cover the way something is used and works. All that\'s left at issue in this litigation is design patents, which cover the look of the iPhone\'s outer shell, software icons, and other features.\n\nArguing Articles\n\nEssentially, Samsung complained about the verdict because it involved Apple getting paid for the whole phone, even though the design patents only covered specific aspects of the phone\'s hardware and software.\n\nThe US Supreme Court said that it was wrong to give Apple damages on the entire phone because of a few design patents. The phone, the justices argue, wasn\'t necessarily the right \"article of manufacture\" to consider. But the high court didn\'t say what the right article should be, and it didn\'t rule out the idea of using the entire phone—the Supreme Court just said the entire phone shouldn\'t automatically be used.\n\nThat led the parties to gear up arguments for an incredible fourth jury trial. Apple and Samsung made their arguments over what the test should be, but Judge Koh ended up going with the test suggested by the US solicitor general, which has four factors to determine the right \"article of manufacture.\" It\'s closer to Apple\'s suggestion—Samsung had suggested basically taking only the part of the product that had the patented design physically applied to it, a test that Koh said wouldn\'t even pass the basics of what the Supreme Court had asked for.\n\nThe factors of the four-part test that will apply are laid out at the end of Koh\'s order. They are:\n\nThe scope of the design claimed in the plaintiff\'s patent, including the drawing and written description;\n\nThe relative prominence of the design within the product as a whole;\n\nWhether the design is conceptually distinct from the product as a whole; and\n\nThe physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product, including whether the design pertains to a component that a user or seller can physically separate from the product as a whole, and whether the design is embodied in a component that is manufactured separately from the rest of the product, or if the component can be sold separately.\n\nKoh also ruled that Apple should bear the burden of proof in determining the article of manufacture.\n\nDesign dilemma\n\nAt this point, any possible result of the lawsuit has long been factored in to the bottom line of these two mega-rich corporations. No possible outcome could really change the fortunes of either one.\n\nThe long case reflects indecision over what to do about design patents. Such patents are just one small aspect of a sprawling intellectual property system that weren\'t a hot topic of discussion, even in legal circles, until Apple\'s litigation made them important.\n\nWe live in a society that recognizes how creative design can have huge value, and that\'s not a bad thing. No one has leveraged that cultural bias more intensely than Apple, which has not only translated design into unprecedented profits but has convinced judges, juries, and lawmakers that it should be allowed to wield design as a powerful tool to stop competitors.\n\nApple has diligently worked to create a world where design can be effectively weaponized. But when judges have analyzed the actual results of such heavy enforcement, what they find may be uncomfortable. Huge awards could stifle innovation by dealing wipe-out blows to companies (not Samsung, but others) for reasons that range from tangential to trivial. The \"solution\" in this case has been to create judicial paralysis and to allow never-ending litigation.', 'After Supreme Court detour, Apple v. Samsung goes to a fourth jury trial'),

Gorsuch was welcomed by conservatives of all stripes because of his deep commitment to judicial originalism. However, in a certain notable way, Gorsuch differs from his predecessor, the late Antonin Scalia, who was also a champion of originalism. A recent statement by the new justice highlights both this difference and a potential stinging point for President Trump and his branch of government.\n\nThis past week, the Supreme Court rejected a petition for certiorari in a case involving administrative agency law. The case, Scenic America v. Department of Transportation, involves a dispute between a nonprofit organization and the Federal Highway Administration. Though the Supreme Court ultimately did not accept the case, Justice Gorsuch issued a very revealing statement in response to the petition.\n\nIn his statement, the justice seems to challenge the legal concept of Chevron deference, in a sharp contrast to his predecessor who supported it. Chevron deference describes the deference a court grants to a federal administrative agency when it comes to statutory interpretation. Under such deference, articulated in the 1984 case Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, courts will typically accept an agency’s interpretation of a statute as long as it can be construed as reasonable (a very low burden). There have historically been a couple salient reasons for this. First, agencies are often thought to be experts in their own subject matter. And second, it is thought that agencies should be given deference in their interpretations by virtue of the fact that Congress delegated certain legislative powers to them.\n\nThe issue in Scenic America is slightly more complex, however, because the case doesn’t explicitly involve an agency’s interpretation of a statute. Instead, the case concerns an agency’s interpretation of a contract that it is party to with a state. The circuit court held that the Chevron test for reasonableness should nevertheless be applied in cases involving contractual interpretation—but the matter is disputed by other circuits.\n\nGorsuch, in his response to the petition for cert, seems very skeptical of the appellate court’s line of reasoning. “But contracts usually represent compromises between two or more parties. And is it reasonable to suppose that one side to a compromise always has more expert insight into its meaning?” he writes.\n\nPerhaps Gorsuch has a good point. Expanding Chevron deference to include the interpretation of contracts would seem to give unequal power to one party in a contract, namely the governmental agency. At the same time, it is an undeniable fact that Gorsuch’s argument would weaken the power of the administrative state by stripping it of its ability to authoritatively interpret contracts.\n\nGorsuch’s statement is particularly interesting because it reveals what could be for President Trump an unintended consequence of his decision to appoint the new justice. The president, who ultimately oversees the administrative state, may be surprised to learn that Gorsuch wants to curb his power.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is not the first time in his career that Gorsuch has expressed disdain for Chevron deference. He did so most famously in another case entitled Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, where he authored both the majority opinion and a concurrent opinion specifically intended to take aim at Chevron deference.', 'Gorsuch\'s Views On Administrative Law Could Spell Trouble For the Executive Branch'),

This divide is more fundamental than mere partisan identification, as there are Democrats and Republicans in both groups.\n\nOne of the best formulations of this division comes from photographer Chris Arnade, who has spent years documenting the lives of America’s forgotten classes. In his characterization, America is split between the “Front Row Kids,” who did well in school, moved to managerial or financial or political jobs and see themselves as the natural rulers of their fellow citizens, and the “Back Row Kids,” who placed less emphasis on school and who resent the pretensions and bossiness of the Front Row Kids.\n\nMore: President Trump: With tax reform we can make it morning in America again\n\nMore: Donald Trump is restoring respect for constitutional limits\n\nWhile teaching constitutional law after the election, it occurred to me that while the Back Row Kids can elect whomever they want as president, senators or representatives, there is one branch of the federal government (and all state governments) that is, more or less by its nature, limited to Front Row Kids: the judiciary.\n\nSomeone like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker can hold office without a college degree, but as a practical matter, the judiciary is limited to people who hold both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Since law degrees became a required part of admission to the bar, the judicial branch has been the domain of people who are not merely highly educated, but educated in the particular way that law schools educate. They are, in short, Front Row Kids of the first order.\n\nAfter realizing that, my march through the decisions of the Warren Court and its successors took on a different flavor. Again and again, seen through the lens of this class divide, important decisions look like decisions on behalf of the Front Row Kids. In the famous Goldberg v. Kelly case granting due-process hearings prior to the termination of welfare benefits, the Supreme Court looks to have been holding on behalf of poor and uneducated people. Yet it turns out that the actual beneficiaries are the highly educated: Social workers and lawyers, who are paid out of welfare agency budgets. Likewise, the court’s treatment of everything from reproductive rights to legislative apportionment has reflected Front Row priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, has become more and more elite. Increasingly, judges aren’t just law school graduates, they’re graduates of the most elite law schools. And that goes double for the Supreme Court, where everyone is a graduate of Harvard or Yale except for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who got her degree from that scrappy Ivy League upstart, Columbia. As Dahlia Lithwick observed in 2014:\n\n“The current justices are intellectually qualified in ways we have never seen. Compared with the political operators, philanderers and alcoholics of bygone eras, they are almost completely devoid of bad habits or scandalous secrets. This is, of course, not a bad thing in itself. But the court has become worryingly cloistered ... There is not a single justice “from the heartland,” as Clarence Thomas has complained. There are no war veterans (like John Paul Stevens), former Cabinet officials (like Robert Jackson), or capital defense attorneys. The Supreme Court that decided Brown v. Board of Education had five members who had served in elected office. The Roberts Court has none. What we have instead are nine perfect judicial thoroughbreds who have spent their entire adulthoods on the same lofty, narrow trajectory.”\n\nLithwick wrote this before the accession of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the court, but his background is the exception that proves the rule. Although some see him as bringing heartland values because he came to the court from Colorado, he is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. Only in today’s Supreme Court, composed of “judicial thoroughbreds,” would his resume seem even a little bit populist.\n\nMore: Memo to both parties: Stop foot-dragging on Children\'s Health Insurance\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with thoroughbreds as such, and if the court decided only narrow technical issues of law none of this would matter. But some of the most important social issues of the day come before the court, and given its members’ insularity, the problem is not just that Back Row America’s values won’t be considered — it’s that the court may not even realize it’s ignoring them. It’s worse still when you realize that, as Angelo Codevilla has noted, America’s ruling class is itself much narrower than it used to be:\n\n“Today’s ruling class, from Boston to San Diego, was formed by an educational system that exposed them to the same ideas and gave them remarkably uniform guidance, as well as tastes and habits. These amount to a social canon of judgments about good and evil, complete with secular sacred history, sins (against minorities and the environment) and saints. Using the right words and avoiding the wrong ones when referring to such matters — speaking the ‘in’ language — serves as a badge of identity.\"\n\nTo counteract this, we might want to bring a bit more diversity to the court. I’m not recommending that we eliminate the informal requirement that judges have law degrees (though non-lawyer judges were common in colonial times, and some countries still use them). But maybe we should look outside the Ivy League and the federal appellate courts. A Supreme Court justice who served on a state court — especially one who had to run for election — would probably have a much broader view of America than a thoroughbred who went from the Ivy League, to an appellate clerkship, to a fancy law firm.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY\'s Board of Contributors.

Davis has not received much attention from court-watchers anticipating a slew of blockbuster cases this term, but the justices\' ruling on the dispute could have a lasting impact on many criminal and death penalty cases and the legal protections given to illegal immigrants.\n\nA Texas court sentenced Carlos Manuel Ayestas, a Honduran man, to death in 1997 after his conviction for murdering Santiago Paneque during a burglary of her Houston home.\n\nAyestas appealed his conviction on the grounds that his trial lawyer failed to collect testimony from his family members who could have provided evidence to support his case. The Texas courts rejected Ayestas\' appeals.\n\nThen in 2009, Ayestas again appealed his case, this time with a different lawyer, and said his trial attorney failed to conduct a reasonable investigation that would have yielded \"available and abundant\" evidence of mitigating factors. Ayestas said that evidence would have revealed relevant information about his upbringing and that he suffered from early-stage schizophrenia, addiction, and other mental illnesses.\n\nAyestas\'s father was purportedly 20 years older than his mother when they met, and his dad fathered 22 children with several women. After fathering three children himself by the time he was 17, Ayestas traveled to the U.S. while telling his mother that he was headed to Guatemala. Along the way, Ayestas\' family has said, he was abducted in Mexico and held for ransom.\n\nA federal district court ruled against Ayestas\' later appeal on a procedural matter, saying that Ayestas had not raised the new claims in earlier proceedings in the Texas state court. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.\n\nBut a ruling from the Supreme Court may have helped breathe new life into Ayestas\' case. The Supreme Court issued a 7-2 opinion in Martinez v. Ryan, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2012, which said that an attorney\'s blunders in court proceedings after a conviction do not give the courts a reason to excuse procedural defaults.\n\nAyestas sought a rehearing in light of that decision and filed a motion for investigative assistance that he deemed \"reasonably necessary\" to prove his claims. The federal courts shot down his motion.\n\nNow, the Supreme Court is looking to determine whether the investigative services Ayestas wants are \"reasonably necessary\" only if petitioners have prevailed in earlier proceedings of the sort that Ayestas lost.\n\nAt the time of Kennedy\'s opinion in Martinez v. Ryan, the late Justice Antonin Scalia dissented because he thought Kennedy was creating a constitutional right to effective counsel in collateral court proceedings, such as the later hearings on Ayestas\' appeals.\n\n\"Despite the court\'s protestations to the contrary, the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose considerable economic costs on the states and further impair their ability to provide justice in a timely fashion,\" Scalia wrote in his 2012 dissent. \"The balance it strikes between the finality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such claims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue (since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas joined Scalia\'s 2012 dissent.\n\nWhether Scalia\'s successor, Justice Neil Gorsuch, shares the late justice\'s view or that of his former boss — Kennedy — could prove critical in determining the outcome and scope of the high court\'s decision in Ayestas. The court agreed to hear Ayestas less than one week before Gorsuch joined the high court.\n\nA ruling in favor of Ayestas could provide convicts fighting death sentences with additional avenues to delay their executions. Whether that factor plays into the thinking of justices on the high court\'s ideological left, remains to be seen.

The court is slated to hear more big cases in the first month of its 2017 term than it did all of last year.\n\nThe justices returned to work on Sept. 25 and began hearing oral arguments Oct. 2. It marked the start of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s first full term, months after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nNo longer afraid of a 4-4 split, some of the significant constitutional issues before the court include cell phone privacy, partisan gerrymandering and the rights of same-sex couples. The justices also have agreed to consider key cases that will impact the business community, including those involving intellectual property, employment law and corporate liability.\n\nGov. Chris Christie’s fight to legalize sports gambling in New Jersey also will come to an end one way or another as the court takes up Christie v. NCAA and New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association v. NCAA. While the lower courts have rejected the state’s argument that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act is unconstitutional, New Jersey may have a better shot with the Roberts Court, which has been critical of federal overreach.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of several other highly anticipated cases on the Supreme Court’s docket so far:\n\nGill v. Whitford: The court will revisit the issue of partisan gerrymandering this term. While gerrymanders that dilute the votes of a particular race clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, the court has struggled to establish a test for partisan gerrymandering. The justices first must determine whether such claims are justiciable and, if so, determine the proper standard for assessing whether the redistricting plan passed by Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled legislature in 2011 is permissible.\n\nCarpenter v. United States: This Fourth Amendment case will determine whether law enforcement officers must obtain a warrant to access historical cell-site records, which indicate which cell towers a cellphone connected with while it was in use and can be used to track a suspect’s location. While the court’s third-party doctrine traditionally has held that certain records or information shared with third parties are not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, the court’s precedents all predate the proliferation of cell phones, the Internet and electronic data.\n\nJesner v. Arab Bank: The court is slated to finally address whether corporations can be held liable under the Alien Tort Statute. Enacted in 1789, the federal statute states that U.S. courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil lawsuit “by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” The decision will impact the extent that corporations can be held liable for transactions with suspected terrorist organizations as well as human rights abuses committed overseas.\n\nMarinello v. United States: The court will resolve a circuit split over whether a conviction under the U.S. Tax Code for “corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the tax laws” requires proof that the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending Internal Revenue Service action. The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and three other circuits, have held that a defendant may be guilty of obstructing the administration of the tax code even if the defendant has no knowledge of a pending IRS action or proceeding or even if there is no pending IRS action or proceeding.\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission: The latest same-sex marriage case to come before the court involves a Colorado bakery’s refusal to create a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. While the lower court ruled that refusing to bake the wedding cake amounted to sexual orientation discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, the bakery owner argues that compelling him to create expression that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage violates the free speech or free exercise clauses of the First Amendment.\n\nThe court will continue to add cases to its docket over the course of the term.

American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, Docket No. 16-1466, the governor of Illinois, along with two public sector employees, brought suit challenging a law that allows public sector employers to require nonmember employees to pay a fee to the union. The governor alleged the law violates the First Amendment by forcing public employees to contribute money to an organization that they may not approve of.

Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), involved a Michigan law authorizing union representation of public sector employees through an agency shop arrangement. The agency shop arrangement required all employees represented by the union, even if the employee is not a union member, to pay a fee as a condition of employment. A group of teachers filed suit alleging they opposed unions in the public sector, that the union was engaged in political activities the teachers did not approve and were not related to the collective bargaining activities, and requested the agency shop clause be declared invalid under state law and the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately held that the service charges used to finance expenditures by the union for collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes, are valid. Union expenditures not germane to its duties as a collective bargaining representative, however, must be financed from employees who do not object to advancing those causes or coerced into doing so against their will by threat of loss of employment.\n\nJust last year, the U.S. Supreme Court examined this very issue in Friedrichs v.

Instead, Jane Doe was forced to go to a Crisis Pregnancy Center, where minors receive counseling directed to dissuade them from having abortions.\n\nThe abortion was delayed for weeks while lawyers with the ACLU and the Trump administration battled over the federal government\'s role in allowing Doe to have the procedure. The ACLU claimed the federal government was forcing Doe to continue her pregnancy against her will and that she has the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the federal government is not required to facilitate an abortion for a minor in its custody and that Doe could seek the procedure by returning to her home country or having her custody transferred to a sponsor that agrees to take her to an abortion clinic.\n\n“Justice prevailed today for Jane Doe.

Millett, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, first dissented from a decision by a three-judge panel delaying an undocumented minor’s abortion. Her dissent was so powerful that when the full D.C. Circuit eventually reversed the panel’s ruling, it did nothing more than explain in a single paragraph that Millett had it right. The judge then took a well-earned victory lap, penning a trenchant concurrence that excoriated her conservative colleague’s anti-abortion, anti-immigrant casuistry. Her brilliant performance secured a vulnerable young woman’s right to bodily autonomy. It should also earn Millett a spot at the very top of the Supreme Court shortlist the next time a Democratic president gets tasked with making a selection.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nEven before Millett’s recent triumph, the 54-year-old judge was widely recognized as a Supreme Court contender. Her resume is sterling: She graduated from Harvard Law, clerked on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and worked at the Department of Justice preparing and arguing appellate cases. She then served as an assistant to the solicitor general, ultimately arguing 25 cases before the Supreme Court. Millett then took a job at the prestigious firm Akin Gump in 2007 and continued to argue before the justices. In June 2013, President Barack Obama nominated her, along with Robert L. Wilkins and Nina Pillard, to the D.C. Circuit. That December, Democrats eliminated the filibuster for lower-court nominees in order to confirm the trio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMillett’s role in the Jane Doe ordeal illustrates why Obama was eager to elevate her to the bench. The saga began in September, when the Trump administration tried to stop Doe, an undocumented 17-year-old, from obtaining an abortion. Doe arrived in the country illegally and was placed in a federally funded shelter, which refused to let her terminate her pregnancy, following a government directive. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Doe sued, alleging a violation of her constitutional right to abortion access. A district court ruled in her favor, but the Justice Department appealed. The case was assigned to a panel of three randomly selected judges: Millett, plus conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Karen L. Henderson.\n\nAt oral arguments, Millett laid bare the flaws in the DOJ attorney’s argument. The government claimed it did not want to “facilitate” Doe’s abortion and that Doe could self-deport if she wanted the procedure. But in reality, Millett noted, the government was merely vetoing Doe’s abortion, asserting direct control over her reproductive capacities in clear violation of the Constitution.\n\nInitially, Millett’s fierce questioning seemed to be for naught. Later that day, Kavanaugh and Henderson crafted a nonsensical order that further postponed Doe’s abortion, requiring her to acquire a sponsor before exercising her right to choose. In response, Millett wrote a searing dissent lambasting both her colleagues and the government. “There are no winners in cases like this,” Millett began:\n\nBut there sure are losers. As of today, J.D. has already been forced by the government to continue an unwanted pregnancy for almost four weeks, and now, as a result of this order, must continue to carry that pregnancy for multiple more weeks. Forcing her to continue an unwanted pregnancy just in the hopes of finding a sponsor that has not been found in the past six weeks sacrifices J.D.’s constitutional liberty, autonomy, and personal dignity for no justifiable governmental reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith remarkable clarity given the time constraints, Millett explained why the government may not, consistent with the Due Process Clause, block Doe’s abortion. “The United States argues that a federal government official in Washington, D.C.” can control Doe’s medical decisions, she wrote:\n\nNo judicial bypass exists for that federal official’s decision. That is an astonishing power grab, and it flies in the teeth of decades of Supreme Court precedent preserving and protecting the fundamental right of a woman to make an informed choice whether to continue a pregnancy at this early stage.\n\nMillett also attacked an amicus brief filed by the Texas attorney general arguing that undocumented immigrants like Doe are not “persons” under the Constitution and thus have no rights. “The implications of amici’s argument,” she wrote, are “deeply troubling”:\n\nIf true, then that would mean she and everyone else here without lawful documentation … have no constitutional right to bodily integrity in any form. … They could be forced to have abortions. They could, if raped by government officials who hold them in detention, then be forced to carry any pregnancies to term. Even if pregnancy would kill the mother, the Constitution would turn a blind eye. Detainees would have no right to any medical treatment or protection from abuse by other detainees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“J.D. retains her basic rights to personhood,” Millett concluded.\n\nAfter all, this child fled here all alone in a desperate effort to avoid severe abuse. And, unfortunately, other women and girls desperate to escape abuse, sexual trafficking, and forced prostitution undoubtedly will also find themselves on our shores and pregnant. … When they decide that their dire circumstances leave them in no position to carry a pregnancy to term, the Constitution forbids the government from directly or effectively prohibiting their exercise of that right in the manner it has done here.\n\nThe dissent came down on Friday evening. On Sunday, armed with Millett’s opinion, the ACLU asked the full D.C. Circuit to vacate the panel decision and allow Doe to get an abortion. Two days later, the court rescinded the panel’s order by a 6–3 vote and ruled in Doe’s favor. In an extraordinary and unusual move, the court did not issue a majority opinion. Instead, it simply wrote that it agreed with Millett. In just four days, her opinion had been transformed from a dissent into the law.\n\nBut Millett wasn’t finished. Kavanaugh, clearly furious about the sudden reversal of fortune, dissented from Tuesday’s order, complaining that the government had a substantial interest in “seeking to place the minor in a better place when deciding” whether “to make a major life decision.” Millett retorted that “J.D. has already made her decision, and neither the government nor the dissenting opinion identifies a constitutionally sufficient justification … for requiring J.D. to wait for what may or may not be a better environment.”\n\nWant More SCOTUS?

Join Dahlia Lithwick and her stable of standout guests for a discussion about the high court and the country’s most important cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe also scorned Kavanaugh’s paternalistic suggestion that, with a “support network of friends and family,” Doe might back out of the abortion. She pointed out that Doe had already received judicial bypass, as required by Texas law, to terminate her pregnancy. “Unfortunately, the central reason for the bypass process,” Millett wrote, “is that pregnant girls and women too often find themselves [in] dangerous situations … in which those networks have broken down.” Condescending judges like Kavanaugh do not get to force these women to chat with their “network” to delay “the exercise of reproductive choice.” (Henderson, too, wrote a dissent to Tuesday’s ruling, arguing that Doe does not qualify as a “person” under the Due Process Clause. Millett chose not to re-engage with this outrageously wrongheaded, Dred Scott–esque assertion, which she had already countered in her first dissent.)\n\n“The court today,” Millett concluded, “correctly recognizes that J.D.’s unchallenged right under the Due Process Clause affords this 17-year-old a modicum of the dignity, sense of self-worth, and control over her own destiny that life seems to have so far denied her.”', 'The Democrats\' Next Supreme Court Nominee'),

The agency oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors who enter the United States illegally and had refused her requests for an abortion.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday restored a lower court’s ruling against HHS. The new ruling ordered HHS to step aside and allow the teen to go forward with an abortion.\n\nThe Trump administration did not appeal to the Supreme Court before the procedure, but advocates for the teen — referred to in court filings as Jane Doe to shield her identity — rushed to arrange the abortion after the ruling Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m relieved for Jane Doe, but I’m so incredibly frustrated that we had to go through all of this for what is a very well-settled constitutional right,” Brigitte Amiri, an ACLU lawyer who argued for the teen in court, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe teen illegally entered the U.S. in September and learned she was pregnant while in federal custody in Texas. She obtained a state court order on Sept. 25 permitting an abortion. But federal officials refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others could take her for the procedure.\n\nHHS argued it had established a policy of “refusing to facilitate” abortions for people in its care. Government lawyers said the teen could ask to be returned to her country of origin instead of seeking an abortion while in HHS’ custody.\n\nLawyers for the teen said government officials were illegally denying medical care to which the teen was entitled, and that the shelter had instead taken her to a crisis pregnancy center. Such centers try to discourage pregnant women from having abortions.\n\nThe ACLU sued HHS last year, during the Obama administration, over its funding of facilities run by religiously affiliated groups that oppose abortion. But Amiri said the agency has been far more active under the Trump administration in trying to intervene in individual cases and stop abortions.\n\nIn emails released by the ACLU, Scott Lloyd, the head of HHS’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors, is quoted telling a subordinate in March that its facilities “should not be supporting abortion services pre or post-release.” Lloyd is quoted in other emails asking about the specific case of another pregnant teenager and offering to find a “few good families” to “see her through her pregnancy.”\n\nThe teen’s case “is a canary in the coal mine,” Amiri said. “It is emblematic of what is to come.”\n\nJane’s Due Process, a Texas group that works with minors seeking abortions, said it and other groups had raised private money to pay for the teen’s abortion. It said lawyers appointed to represent the teen’s interests would take her from the South Texas facility where she was being held to and from an abortion clinic.\n\nLawyers for the teen have not identified her name or country of origin, citing privacy reasons, but have said she was from Central America. But they said the teen feared having her parents find out that she wanted an abortion because she had seen them abuse a sister who was pregnant.\n\nThe teen was about 15 weeks pregnant, and Texas law bans most abortions after 20 weeks.\n\n“It shouldn’t take dozens of lawyers for anyone to get an abortion, and that’s what it took in this case,” said Susan Hays, legal director for Jane’s Due Process.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued in court filings that the teen did not have a constitutional right to an abortion, called the case “tragic” and argued it could “pave the way for anyone outside the United States to unlawfully enter and obtain an abortion.” Paxton noted in his statement that the U.S. Department of Justice did not appeal the circuit court’s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHHS and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'Immigrant teen has abortion after federal appeals court rules in her favor, ACLU says'),

She dreamed of studying nursing and, someday, caring for senior citizens.

Schneiderman, one of 14 Democratic attorneys general who filed a court brief in support of the girl, said the group stands “ready to support every other Jane Doe fighting for the fundamental right to make her own health care decisions.”\n\nThe Trump administration said in court that it has a new policy of refusing to “facilitate” abortions for unaccompanied minors taken into federal custody after crossing the border illegally.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the teen, said that policy violates the minors’ constitutional right to an abortion in the United States.\n\nHundreds of pregnant undocumented immigrants have been in federal custody in recent years, according to court filings.\n\n“Justice prevailed today for Jane Doe. But make no mistake about it, the administration’s efforts to interfere in women’s decisions won’t stop with Jane,” said Brigitte Amiri, the ACLU attorney who argued the case in court.\n\n[Appeals court delays abortion for undocumented teen]\n\nThe abortion on Wednesday followed a roller-coaster legal battle that moved swiftly through the courts, with judges issuing contradictory rulings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit took the unusual step of reversing a three-judge panel of the same court without first holding oral argument.\n\nThe panel’s decision, issued Friday, would have postponed the abortion.\n\nInstead, the D.C. Circuit’s 6-to-3 ruling sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who hours later reissued an earlier order requiring the government to let the teen have the abortion “promptly and without delay.”\n\nHer guardians rushed to arrange transportation to the nearest abortion provider. The Justice Department mulled whether to ask the Supreme Court to put the D.C. Circuit order on hold.\n\nGovernment lawyers, who did not immediately ask for a hold after the Tuesday ruling, may have miscalculated how quickly the teen could receive an abortion.\n\nTexas law requires counseling from a doctor at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion, but the 17-year-old underwent that counseling Oct. 19, allowing her to go forward with the procedure once Chutkan issued her order.\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court opened for business Wednesday, it appears there was no issue left for the justices to decide.\n\nThe teen was more than 15 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy was terminated. Texas bars abortions, except in the case of a medical emergency, after 20 weeks. In her statement, the teen expressed frustration that the government earlier took her to a Christian pregnancy center, where workers urged her to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n“They made me see a doctor that tried to convince me not to abort and to look at sonograms,” she said. “People I don’t even know are trying to make me change my mind.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have pressed Eric Hargan, acting secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, about why the Trump administration changed federal policy to block access to abortions for minors in custody.\n\nHHS, which is responsible for caring for detained unaccompanied minors, has said the government is trying to “promote child birth and fetal life.” Scott Lloyd, who directs the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, has personally intervened to try to persuade unaccompanied minor girls not to have abortions, according to HHS.\n\nHHS officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday. Lloyd is slated to testify Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on immigration and border security on unrelated immigration issues. He could also be asked about the abortion case.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit’s ruling on Tuesday to allow the abortion was opposed by the court’s three active judges nominated to the bench by Republican presidents. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh said the majority had created a new right for undocumented immigrant minors in custody to “immediate abortion on demand.”\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson went further in a separate dissent finding that the undocumented teenager had no constitutional right to an elective abortion. “To conclude otherwise rewards lawlessness and erases the fundamental difference between citizenship and illegal presence in our country,” she wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the undocumented teenager had asked the full appeals court to rehear her case after the three-judge panel ruled 2 to 1 to give HHS until Oct. 31 to find a sponsor to take custody of the girl. That would have allowed her to be released and to seek the abortion without government involvement.\n\nGovernment lawyers told the court that prospective sponsors had inquired about the teenager.

Whitford told the Supreme Court earlier this month, \"gerrymanders now are not your father\'s gerrymander.\" This case challenges the extreme partisan gerrymander of the 2011 map for districts in the Wisconsin state legislature.\n\nFull disclosure: I signed an amicus brief in Gill with 11 other constitutional and election law scholars arguing that the Wisconsin map violated the First Amendment. The argument was based on the First Amendment\'s right of free association. Not only does someone have the right to join with others to exercise political influence, such as joining a political party, but a person has the right not to be discriminated against because of their tie to that organization. I was in good company in trying to persuade the court. More than 50 amicus briefs have been filed in the case. The reason everyone wants to get a word in is because Gill could set the standards and rules for how district lines are drawn in the future.\n\nThe origins of the case lie in secret Wisconsin state legislative electoral maps drawn by Republicans, who controlled both houses of the legislature, after the 2010 census. Democratic lawmakers (and even some Republicans) were shut out of the process. Litigation in the lower courts revealed that the maps were revised multiple times so the Republicans would gain maximum partisan advantage. The three-judge panel that first heard the case found the Wisconsin map violated the constitution and then ordered the legislature to redraw the map. That effort was put on hold as the matter went to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Gerrymandering\" is the pejorative word used to describe the drawing of district lines that favor one party or another. One of the ways gerrymanders can thwart the will of the voters is when district lines are drawn in such a way that minority of voters can wind up electing a super-majority of legislators. A clever gerrymander -- or many would argue -- a pernicious gerrymander can thwart the will of voters by allowing a minority (or a narrow majority) to elect a super-majority of legislators. This is precisely what happened in the 2012 and 2014 elections for the 99-seat Wisconsin Assembly. In 2012, Republicans won 60 Assembly seats despite winning only 48.6 percent of the two-party state-wide vote; in 2014, they won 63 seats with only 52 percent of the state-wide vote. Thus in its worst form, gerrymandering thwarts the democratic norm of majority rule.\n\nGerrymandering is also a source of incumbent protection and partisan advantage. When lawmakers draw their own lines, politicians pick their voter instead of the other way around. Politicians can look at voting patterns and cut out voters from neighborhoods that historically vote for the other party -- thereby creating skewed safe districts for incumbent politicians.\n\nBut courts have traditionally been reluctant to resolve redistricting disputes, heeding Justice Felix Frankfurter\'s 1946 warning that courts \"ought not to enter the political thicket.\" For most of American history, courts considered redistricting fights nonjusticiable -- meaning the courts would not hear them.\n\nBut state legislatures proved they could not be trusted with redistricting. By the time the Warren Court examined the results of decades of judicial neglect, they found states with such wildly different sized districts that voters\' votes literally had different weights. Over Frankfurter\'s vigorous dissent, the Court ruled in Baker v. Carr in 1962 that not only could the courts hear redistricting cases, it set the standard of \"one-person, one-vote,\" meaning that each district should have equal population.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also ruled that gerrymanders that favor a particular race are disallowed. But the court has struggled with the issue of whether partisan gerrymanders -- those that favor a particular party -- are also forbidden. Back in 2004, in Vieth v. Jubelirer, the court came close to ruling that partisan gerrymanders are nonjusticiable, but Justice Anthony Kennedy was not ready to totally close the courthouse door to such claims.\n\nWhich bring us back to Gill v. Whitford and its importance. Back in July, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Gill \"is perhaps the most important\" case the court has chosen to hear this term. At oral argument, Ginsburg again emphasized the stakes: \"I would like to ask you what\'s really behind all of this: The precious right to vote. If you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote? Whether it\'s a Democratic district or a Republican district, the result -- using this map, the result is preordained in most of the districts. … Would we have that result when the individual citizen says: I have no choice, I\'m in this district, and we know how this district is going to come out? I mean, that\'s something that this society should be concerned about?\"\n\nGill gives the Supreme Court a chance to decide whether courts can hear partisan gerrymandering claims, just in time for the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census. As Smith implored the Justices to recognize: \"we\'re here telling you [that] you are the only institution in the United States that can … solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse.\"', 'The Supreme Court Is the Only Institution in the US That Can Solve the Gerrymandering Problem'),

The concern is not a new one for John Roberts. It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the public’s view.\n\n“It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,” he said then, adding: “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.”\n\nSo I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: “The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.”\n\nAnd assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal. The gap isn’t huge — 30 percent “too conservative” to 23 percent “too liberal” — but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant. In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, “too liberal” outstripped “too conservative” with a gap of 17 percent. Gallup’s analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third. In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.\n\nThe chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the court’s modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them. There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the court’s liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure. That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument. And I’d like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart. Whatever happens with this case — a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately — there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.\n\nIn the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the court’s hands on these issues. Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases. It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina. In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings. These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.\n\nThe Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court. When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Court’s door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the court’s interests are best served by sitting it out?', 'Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Court\'s Legitimacy?'),

Or it would have been, if the local flood-control district hadn’t taken it to shore up protection against hurricanes in the low-lying area that brushes up against the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJarreau, 44, knows all too well about flooding, having a lost a home on another property to Hurricane Katrina. But he also wants to be paid what he considers a fair price. So he’s asked the Supreme Court to step in. The justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case.\n\n“I’ve been digging on this land since I bought it,” Jarreau said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t think they could just take your land like that. I thought if they damaged your property, I thought they’d take care of it.”\n\nThe case raises a legal issue that the court hasn’t dealt with in nearly 70 years. The issue is whether the “just compensation” the Constitution says a government must pay when it takes someone’s property includes the value of the business that is lost because of the government’s action.\n\nLouisiana’s Supreme Court ruled against Jarreau. State supreme courts and federal courts are divided about whether governments must cover business losses when they take private property, said Robert McNamara, a lawyer for the libertarian Institute for Justice, representing Jarreau.\n\nThe South Lafourche Levee District is responsible for flood control in the portion of the 106-mile Bayou Lafourche that runs through Cut Off before eventually draining into the Gulf. The district took the dirt from just under an acre of Jarreau’s land as well as property from some neighbors, under Louisiana laws strengthened after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nWithout the levee system, Jarreau’s property would flood frequently, said Loulan Pitre Jr., a former state lawmaker who is the lawyer for the levee district. “There is a strong policy to say that this is all subject to flooding and it’s reasonable to expect a small sacrifice to protect everyone.”\n\nThe levee district certainly thought the sacrifice was small. It initially sent Jarreau a check for $1,326 after notifying him in 2011 that it was going to take the dirt from Jarreau’s land that was closest to the bayou.\n\nJarreau couldn’t believe the paltry sum and kept digging because he had a contract for 23,000 cubic yards (17,600 cubic meters) of dirt — enough to cover a football field nearly a foot deep — with a private company that does a lot of work on the levees in coastal Louisiana.\n\nBut then the levee district sued to make Jarreau stop digging. Their legal fight eventually went to trial. A judge ruled that Jarreau should be paid nearly $12,000 for the land itself and another $164,000 for his business losses. At the end of the state appeals process, Jarreau was left with just the $12,000.\n\nMany properties in the bayous are long rectangles, with the lowest ground near the water and higher land at the other end.\n\nIt’s the property nearest the water, what the locals call the back of their tracts, that can be used for flood control.\n\nJarreau said he didn’t know that before his six-year-long legal fight.\n\n“I dug up pretty much the whole property. I started in the front. I would have started in the back,” he said.', 'Louisiana \'dirt farmer\' asks US Supreme Court\'s help');

Or it would have been, if the local flood control district hadn\'t taken it to shore up protection against hurricanes in the low-lying area that brushes up against the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJarreau, 44, knows all too well about flooding, having a lost a home on another property to Hurricane Katrina. But he also wants to be paid what he considers a fair price. So he\'s asked the Supreme Court to step in. The justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case.\n\n\"I\'ve been digging on this land since I bought it,\" Jarreau said in a telephone interview. \"I didn\'t think they could just take your land like that. I thought if they damaged your property, I thought they\'d take care of it.\"\n\nThe case raises a legal issue that the court hasn\'t dealt with in nearly 70 years. The issue is whether the \"just compensation\" the Constitution says a government must pay when it takes someone\'s property includes the value of the business that is lost because of the government\'s action.\n\nLouisiana\'s Supreme Court ruled against Jarreau. State supreme courts and federal courts are divided about whether governments must cover business losses when they take private property, said Robert McNamara, a lawyer for the libertarian Institute for Justice, representing Jarreau.\n\nThe South Lafourche Levee District is responsible for flood control in the portion of the 106-mile (171-kilometer) Bayou Lafourche that runs through Cut Off before eventually draining into the Gulf. The district took the dirt from just under an acre of Jarreau\'s land as well as property from some neighbors, under Louisiana laws strengthened after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nWithout the levee system, Jarreau\'s property would flood frequently, said Loulan Pitre Jr., a former state lawmaker who is the lawyer for the levee district. \"There is a strong policy to say that this is all subject to flooding and it\'s reasonable to expect a small sacrifice to protect everyone.\"\n\nThe levee district certainly thought the sacrifice was small. It initially sent Jarreau a check for $1,326 after notifying him in 2011 that it was going to take the dirt from Jarreau\'s land that was closest to the bayou.\n\nJarreau couldn\'t believe the paltry sum and kept digging because he had a contract for 23,000 cubic yards (17,600 cubic meters) of dirt — enough to cover a football field nearly a foot deep — with a private company that does a lot of work on the levees in coastal Louisiana.\n\nBut then the levee district sued to make Jarreau stop digging. Their legal fight eventually went to trial. A judge ruled that Jarreau should be paid nearly $12,000 for the land itself and another $164,000 for his business losses. At the end of the state appeals process, Jarreau was left with just the $12,000.\n\nMany properties in the bayous are long rectangles, with the lowest ground near the water and higher land at the other end.\n\nIt\'s the property nearest the water, what the locals call the back of their tracts, that can be used for flood control.\n\nJarreau said he didn\'t know that before his six-year-long legal fight.\n\n\"I dug up pretty much the whole property. I started in the front. I would have started in the back,\" he said.', 'Louisiana \'Dirt Farmer\' Asks Supreme Court\'s Help'),

Savage', '2017-10-27', 'The Supreme Court is weighing whether to hear an anti-abortion group’s challenge on free speech grounds to a California law that requires “crisis pregnancy centers” — which advocate alternatives to the procedure — to also advise clients that the state offers free or low-cost contraception and assistance in ending their pregnancy.\n\nThe justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case, the latest in a series of clashes pitting the 1st Amendment against the state’s power to regulate the medical profession.\n\nThe California Legislature said two years ago that it was concerned that the more than 200 pregnancy centers in California sometimes provided “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices that often confuse, misinform and even intimidate women from making fully informed decisions” about their medical care. The so-called Reproductive FACT Act requires these centers to disclose whether they have medical professionals on the staff and to inform patients that the state offers subsidized contraception and abortion.\n\nLast year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law against claims that the disclosures were a kind of “compelled speech” that violated the 1st Amendment.\n\nBut three separate appeals are pending before the Supreme Court, including one from the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which says it has “over 110 nonprofit, pro-life pregnancy centers” in California.\n\nAt issue is whether “the state of California can compel nonprofit, faith-based, pro-life licensed medical facilities, against their religious convictions and identity, to advertise a government program that provides free or low-cost abortions,” wrote Jay Alan Sekulow, counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice and a personal attorney for President Trump.\n\nAppealing on behalf of the LivingWell Medical Clinic and two others, Sekulow said the disclosure law violates “the principle that one cannot be conscripted into acting as a ventriloquist’s dummy for a government message.”\n\nThe justices have considered the appeals for more than three weeks in their weekly conferences, suggesting at least several of them are inclined to hear the cases.\n\nRecently, lower courts have split on controversies arising from state regulations of medical professionals.\n\nIn a case dubbed “Docs vs. Glocks,” an appeals court in February struck down a Florida law that told doctors they could not question patients about whether they kept firearms at home. The National Rifle Assn. had pressed for the law, but the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta ruled its restrictions violated the free-speech rights of physicians.\n\nSounding the same theme, judges struck down a North Carolina law that would have required doctors before performing an abortion to display for the woman a sonogram of the fetus and to describe the image. “This compelled speech provision violates the 1st Amendment,” the 4th Circuit ruled three years ago.\n\nAnd in a case that is closest to the pending appeal from California, an appeals court in 2014 struck down most of a New York City ordinance that required pregnancy centers to notify patients whether they “provide [abortions] or provide referrals for abortion.” The 2nd Circuit Court said this provision “mandates discussion of a controversial political topic” and is therefore unconstitutional. However, the judges agreed the city could require these centers to disclose whether they had licensed medical professionals available.\n\nBy contrast, the 9th Circuit based in San Francisco has given the state more leeway to regulate the medical profession.\n\nFour years ago, the judges rejected a free-speech challenge to the state law that banned medical providers from offering gay conversion therapy or “sexual orientation change efforts” to patients under age 18. The appeals court said the law “regulates conduct,” not speech. “It bans a form of medical treatment for minors. It does nothing to prevent therapists from discussing the pros and cons of SOCE with their patients,” wrote Judge Susan Graber.\n\nThe last year, a different panel of 9th Circuit judges relied on that decision in upholding the law requiring the religiously affiliated pregnancy centers to post a disclosure notice in the waiting room or to give patients a printed copy. It says, “California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care and abortion for eligible women.” The notice includes a telephone number for the county social services office.\n\nIn a 3-0 ruling, the judges said the state has ample authority to regulate “professional speech” to protect the welfare of patients. The disclosure notice does not “encourage, suggest or imply” that women should seek abortion, wrote Judge Dorothy Nelson. It is “closely drawn to achieve California’s interests in safeguarding public health and fully informing Californians of the existence of publicly funded medical services.” Also upheld were separate provisions that require the centers to notify clients if they are not state licensed and disclose whether they have medical professionals available to provide advice or care.\n\nLawyers for California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra advised the court to turn away the appeal in the case of NIFLA vs. Becerra. The notice rules “fall well within the 1st Amendment’s tolerance for the regulation of the practice-related speech of licensed professionals,” they said.\n\nIf the court agrees to hear the challenge to California’s clinic-disclosure law, it would be the second major case before the high court this term that arises as a conservative 1st Amendment challenge to a liberal state law — and it comes from the same lawyers.\n\nThe Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom, which appealed on behalf of NIFLA, also represents the Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The baker seeks a free-speech exemption to the state’s civil rights laws. The high court will hear his case in December.\n\nMajor questions before the Supreme Court this fall »\n\nCAPTION Las Vegas had had to carefully consider how it markets itself after the Oct. 1 mass shooting.

Petitioners have agreed to cede ten minutes of argument time to the United States and therefore consent to this motion.\n\n“The question presented is whether that application of Colorado law violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as applied to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n“The United States has filed a brief as amicus curiae supporting petitioners, contending that, in the circumstances of this case, the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause bars the application of Colorado’s public accommodations law to petitioners.”\n\nIt continues: “As a general matter, the United States has a substantial interest in the preservation of federal constitutional rights of free expression.\n\n“In addition, the United States has a particular interest in the scope of such rights in the context of the Colorado statute here, which shares certain features with federal public accommodations laws, including Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\n“The United States is thus well positioned to address the reconciliation of content-neutral public accommodations laws with federal constitutional freedoms of speech and expression. Participation by the United States in oral argument would therefore materially assist the Court in its consideration of this case.”\n\nA ruling in favour of the baker could have a chilling effect on LGBT rights protections country-wide, and equality activists fear it may end up creating a license for homophobic discrimination based on religion.\n\nThe case is expected to be close, with Trump’s newly-appointed Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch considered a firm vote for the baker’s freedom to discriminate.\n\nThe Trump administration itself has filed an amicus brief backing the freedom to discriminate.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department claimed that a ruling against the bakery could create an “intrusion” against the First Amendment “where a public accommodations law compels someone to create expression for a particular person or entity and to participate, literally or figuratively, in a ceremony or other expressive event.”\n\n86 Republican members of congress have also signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court supporting the baker’s right to discriminate.\n\nThe gay couple in the case, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, have vowed to stand up for equality.\n\nThey said: “This has always been about more than a cake. Businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love.\n\n“While we’re disappointed that the courts continue debating the simple question of whether LGBT people deserve to be treated like everyone else, we hope that our case helps ensure that no one has to experience being turned away simply because of who they are.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Colorado represent Mullins and Craig in the case.\n\nJames Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBT Project, said: “The law is squarely on David and Charlie’s side because when businesses are open to the public, they’re supposed to be open to everyone.\n\n“While the right to one’s religious beliefs is fundamental, a license to discriminate is not.\n\n“Same-sex couples like David and Charlie deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else, and we’re ready to take that fight all the way to the Supreme Court.”\n\nThe baker is defended by hardline anti-LGBT law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, which has sought to undermine LGBT rights protections in a number of states.\n\nThough the ADF is framing the issue around a religious objection to same-sex marriage, their other cases show a much wider support for licensing anti-LGBT discrimination.\n\nFor instance, they have sued a school district over a transgender non-discrimination policy, and defended a T-shirt printer who refused an order from a Pride celebration.\n\nBritish MPs recently accused Donald Trump of “undermining” work on global LGBTI rights by pursuing a regressive agenda.\n\nAt a debate in the UK’s House of Commons yesterday, politicians from across parties voiced concern at developments in the United States on LGBT issues.\n\nLabour MP Stephen Twigg said: “I want to say something about what is happening in the United States of America. President Trump’s decision to ban transgender people from the US military is an enormous shame, one I hope we can condemn on a cross-party basis.\n\n“I pay tribute to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in America for his positive and measured response to President Trump’s actions. I urge our Government to do all they can to press President Trump to think again on his attempt to ban trans people from the US armed forces.\n\n“That, however, is not the only incident of greater homophobia and transphobia in American politics and policy. Recently, the United States voted against a UN Human Rights Council resolution that condemned the use of the death penalty against people because they are LGBT.\n\n“President Obama left a very positive legacy on LGBT. Tragically, President Trump is undoing it.\n\n“That leaves a vacuum in global LGBT rights. I hope that the United Kingdom, working with like-minded countries around the world, will play a leadership role to ensure we do not slip back, but instead move forward to global LGBT equality.”', 'Trump administration heads to Supreme Court to support \'freedom\' to discriminate against gay ...'),

The operation of the PTAB has resulted in incalculable damage to American innovation by invalidating more than 90% of patent claims subjected to PTAB review. This wholesale annihilation of patent claims even lead Randall Rader – former Chief Judge of the nation’s patent appeals court – to dub the PTAB a “patent death squad” for American patents. The destruction of patent property rights by the PTAB also resulted in a 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis of national patent systems ranking the U.S. patent system as 10th in the world (tied with Hungary); previously, the U.S. patent system had been ranked number one.\n\nEven worse for the American economy and for American technological competitiveness, the inability of American inventors to secure meaningful patent protection for their innovations as a result of the PTAB has led to a marked decline in entrepreneurs starting new businesses. The slump in start-up activity has far-reaching implications for the American economy because start-up businesses have historically been the key drivers in this country of job creation and in the development of cutting-edge technology. As long as the PTAB continues in its mission of invalidating the vast majority of patent claims that it reviews, the reluctance of American inventors to start new businesses and for venture capitalists to invest in these new enterprises will undoubtedly continue.\n\n“Patent rights are grounded in the U.S. Constitution which authorized Congress “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to…inventors the exclusive right to their…discoveries.” “The foresight of the Founding Father in establishing strong patent rights spurred American economic development throughout our history and were critical to technological breakthroughs in fields ranging from transportation and communications to pharmaceuticals.” notes Paul Morinville, the CEO of U.S. Inventor and himself a named inventor on more than 30 U.S. patents and patent applications. “The PTAB has devastated this engine of American prosperity by invalidating patent claims at an alarming rate. Even worse, the PTAB suffers from serious due process issues, including, conflicts of interest by review panel members; “stacking” of review panels to produce desired results; abuses in the consideration of supplementary evidence; denial of patent owners’ ability to respond to arguments against invalidity allegations; and arbitrary and capricious denials of patent holders’ right to amend claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has an opportunity in the Oil States case to undo this damage by declaring the AIA unconstitutional. U.S. Inventor is holding this protest to highlight to the justices and to the public the vital need to abolish the PTAB in order to protect American inventors and American innovation.” added Paul Morinville.\n\nFor further information about U.S. Inventor and to register to participate in this protest, please visit us at: http://www.usinventor.org/oil-states-protest/', 'Protest in Support of American Inventors at the US Supreme Court on November 27th During Oral ...'),

Wade decision legalizing abortion.\n\nU.S. District Judge Myron Thompson in the Middle District of Alabama found the laws unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the state from enforcing the measures, which were signed into law in May 2016 by former Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican.\n\nThe same court last year temporarily blocked both measures in a preliminary injunction, which was under appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe school-proximity law banned clinics within 2,000 feet of a K-8 public school and was the only law of its kind in the United States. Thompson said it would likely have forced the closing of clinics in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa, where 72 percent of the state’s abortions are performed.\n\nThe “fetal-demise law,” which effectively banned the most common method of second-trimester abortion, known as dilation and evacuation, would have prohibited abortions after 15 weeks, Thompson wrote.\n\n“Because these laws clearly impose an impermissible undue burden on a woman’s ability to choose an abortion, they cannot stand,” he wrote.\n\nThe ACLU of Alabama had challenged the laws on behalf of two women’s health clinics in a state where abortion providers have faced what Thompson’s ruling called a “climate of hostility.”\n\n“Both would have had a devastating impact on the ability of women to access abortion in Alabama,” said Randall Marshall, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama.\n\nAlabama’s Attorney General and Republican Governor Kay Ivey’s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. state legislatures enacted 41 new abortion restrictions in the first half of 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.\n\nThose laws have led to a spate of legal challenges in Alabama and elsewhere.

Moore believes the flag represents state-sanctioned hate speech that violates the equal-protection rights of black citizens. He referred to the flag as a \"Jim Crow banner\" in his legal response.\n\nMoore compared the Mississippi flag to the Brown v. Board of Education decision by the Supreme Court, which decided schools violated the Constitution by providing a message of inequality to the state of Kansas, creating a \"feeling of inferiority…that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\"\n\nMoore appealed two legal losses in Mississippi to the Supreme Court, which has not taken the case but asked for both sides to submit arguments—a possible first step toward a full argument. It would be the first time the Supreme Court has weighed in on the Confederate symbol if they choose to take up the case. Previous legal decisions have said Moore failed to prove the flag causes \"identifiable legal injury.\"\n\nThe state argued to the Supreme Court on October 18 that while the Mississippi flag may be deeply offensive to black people, it is not a violation of civil rights. The lawyers said if the lawsuit is upheld, it creates a slippery slope where anyone could challenge any government action or monument by \"simply alleging what cannot be disproved—namely, that he or she suffers denigration, stigma, or like form of discomfiture.\"\n\nMoore\'s case rests on convincing the Supreme Court that lower courts made a \"grievous error\" in not recognizing the \"racially hostile\" and \"demeaning\" state messaging as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe stakes are high, Moore wrote. \"If Mississippi’s conduct does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, then it is undeniable that state and local governments are indeed free to officially demean and marginalize their black citizens, LGBT citizens, Hispanic citizens, Middle Eastern citizens, Asian citizens or any group which finds itself in a disfavored minority.\"', 'Mississippi\'s State Motto Is Basically \'White Supremacy Forever,\' Black Lawyer Tells Supreme Court'),

Patterson', '2017-10-27', 'The extraterritorial reach of U.S. law enforcement will face scrutiny once more, with the Supreme Court granting certiorari this month in the highly-publicized—and hotly-contested—dispute over a warrant for Microsoft emails stored on a foreign server. United States v. Microsoft, No. 17-2 (cert. granted Oct. 16, 2017). The case highlights a recurring tension between public safety and privacy concerns, and underscores the increasing complexity behind the technology we all rely on each day.\n\nIn the last round of the Microsoft saga, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court and quashed a warrant for emails of a criminal suspect that were stored on a Dublin server. Microsoft v. United States, 829 F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2016) (Microsoft). The panel concluded that execution of the warrant would involve an impermissible extraterritorial application of the Stored Communications Act (SCA). Nearly 90 amici, including technology and media companies, civil liberties groups, and governments, had submitted briefs to the circuit and its decision was divisive, even internally: An en banc rehearing was denied by a split 4-4 vote, with strong dissents questioning the merits and implications of the original opinion. Microsoft v. United States, 14-2985 (2d Cir. Jan. 24, 2017). All called for a legislative fix.\n\nSince then, Congress held hearings on law enforcement access to foreign-stored data, but no other circuit court reached the issue. (Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Across Borders: Facilitating Cooperation and Protecting Rights: Hearing before the S. Judiciary Subcomm. on Crime and Terrorism (May 24, 2017); Data Stored Abroad: Ensuring Lawful Access and Privacy Protection in the Digital Era: Hearing before the H. Judiciary Comm. (June 15, 2017)). The various district courts that addressed it, however, roundly disagreed with the Second Circuit’s ruling. According to the government’s petition, service providers are nonetheless resisting SCA warrants based on Microsoft, impeding law enforcement and public safety. While legislative efforts may continue in parallel, the Supreme Court appears to agree that urgency exists to hear the dispute now, even in the absence of a formal circuit split.\n\nBackground\n\nAt issue is §2703 of the SCA, a multi-provision statute that is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. 18 U.S.C. §§2701-2712. The SCA generally affords Fourth Amendment-like protections to electronic communications and prohibits unauthorized access to or disclosure of such information. Section 2703, however, permits the government to use warrants, subpoenas, or court orders to compel disclosure from service providers. Of these options, the government is required to obtain a warrant, on a probable cause showing, for communications stored for less than 180 days. The government can also use a warrant for longer-stored data or else seek such data by subpoena, but only with notice to the accountholder. 18 U.S.C. §2703.\n\nThe service provider here—Microsoft—was served with a §2703 warrant at its U.S. headquarters for “content” and “non-content” information about an email accountholder. As is increasingly common, Microsoft had procedures in place to optimize efficiency by breaking up the electronic account data and storing it in different physical locations. Most of the data, including the content of the emails, automatically migrated to a server in Dublin because the accountholder inputted the country code for Ireland. The email contents could, however, be “collected” and viewed by certain Microsoft employees in the United States.\n\nMicrosoft moved to quash the warrant for the Dublin-stored data on the grounds that it would constitute an impermissible extraterritorial search and seizure. The magistrate judge denied Microsoft’s motion, and the district court affirmed. On appeal, the circuit quashed the warrant, and the government’s writ petition followed.\n\nQuestions for the Court\n\nThe court’s review will begin with at least one area of agreement between the parties: Section 2703 does not provide for extraterritorial application. Indeed, U.S. statutes are presumed not to apply extraterritorially unless otherwise indicated, and the presumption has not been rebutted here. Morrison v. National Australian Bank, 561 U.S. 247 (2010). The court instead will evaluate whether, as the government contends, the Microsoft warrant involves a permissible domestic application of the statute. That question turns on the statute’s focus, and whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred within the United States. RJR Nabisco v. European Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2101 (2016).\n\nThe SCA’s focus is disputed. The circuit held that the language of the SCA and its legislative history make clear that its focus is privacy, and that the relevant conduct is Microsoft’s accessing data located in Ireland. The government’s petition agrees that certain SCA provisions address privacy, but contends that §2703’s focus is disclosure, namely “disclosure in the United States of information that the provider can access domestically with the click of a computer mouse.” The government contends that even if §2703’s focus was privacy, the domestic disclosures are still the relevant conduct; Microsoft does not violate its users’ privacy by internally accessing their data. In any case, the government maintains that privacy interests are protected by the warrant’s probable cause requirement. Petition for Writ of Certiorari (Petition), at 12, 17, 31.\n\nThe very nature of §2703 warrants is also disputed. The magistrate and district judge concluded that SCA warrants, despite their name and probable cause requirements, function more like subpoenas: they require service providers, rather than law enforcement, to gather the requested materials. Subpoena law requires recipients under U.S. jurisdiction to produce information in their possession, custody, and control regardless of its location, leading the lower courts to enforce the Microsoft warrant. On appeal, the circuit held that §2703 clearly distinguishes between subpoenas and warrants, and noted that warrants have “distinctly territorial” limitations. Moreover, the circuit noted that “our Court has never upheld the use of a subpoena to compel a recipient to produce an item under its control and located overseas when the recipient is merely a caretaker for another individual or entity and that individual, not the subpoena recipient, has a protectable privacy interest in the item.” Microsoft, 829 F.3d at 212-16 (citation omitted).\n\nWhose Data Is It Anyway?\n\nIn the government’s view, service providers “control” all accountholder data and must produce requested data regardless of where they choose to store it. But as the circuit noted, such service providers may be more like “caretakers” of data and bound to consider the underlying accountholder’s separate privacy interest. The scope of that interest, in turn, may depend on the identity of the particular user. As the circuit observed, the record is silent on the location and nationality of the Microsoft user who sparked all this litigation. But such details may matter as the court (and Congress) assess these issues.\n\nFor example, in a joint amicus brief supporting the government’s petition, thirty-three states and Puerto Rico represented that service providers have refused to comply with SCA warrants post-Microsoft “even when (1) a court has found probable cause that the email account was used in connection with a domestic crime, (2) the provider can access the requested data from within the United States, and (3) the suspect and the provider are both in the United States.” Brief Amici Curiae of the States of Vermont, et al. in Support of Petitioner, at 3 (emphasis added). In its petition, the government made a similar representation, noting that the “harmful effects of the panel’s decision [] extend beyond investigations involving the email of foreign nationals.” The government added that the Microsoft decision “provides a roadmap for terrorists and criminals in the United States to insulate electronic communications from U.S. investigators—they need do nothing more than falsely state a location outside the United States when signing up for an account.” Petition, at 27.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Congress intended such a result or foresaw it, given the vastly different technology that existed at the SCA’s 1986 passage. The analysis is muddier, however, as to foreign residents and nationals, given traditional warrants’ territorial limits and the potential tensions between U.S. and foreign laws, especially on privacy. Perhaps a starting point, as some have suggested, is to focus on users’ nationality and residence, rather than the location of their data, which may be unconnected for business or technological reasons. See, e.g., Testimony of Richard Salgado, Director, Law Enforcement and Information Security, Google.\n\nConclusion\n\nStakeholders affected by the Microsoft decision agree that serious competing policy considerations must be weighed to align the SCA with modern technology and the increasing importance of digital evidence to law enforcement—not just in the United States, but worldwide. Indeed, any legislative remedies must take into account the parallel data requests made by foreign governments and the potentially conflicting international compliance demanded of service providers. In the meantime, all eyes will be on the Supreme Court as they review the thorny Microsoft issues anew.\n\nPhilip Patterson and Vera Kachnowski practice white-collar criminal defense and international investigations at De Feis O’Connell & Rose, P.C., a Manhattan law firm.', 'Battle Over Emails Stored Overseas Reaches Supreme Court');

(Doug Mills/The New York Times) - Bulletin\n\nA- A+\n\nPublic employee unions in Oregon and elsewhere may face a terrible blow to membership from the U.S. Supreme Court. Oregon unions are already trying to lock people in the union, making it hard to leave and stop paying dues.\n\nOne of Oregon’s largest public employee unions, Service Employees International Union, has a provision that members can only withdraw from the union in a narrow 15-day window that opens once a year. Another of the state’s large public employee unions, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has a provision that is even narrower. It’s 10 days. And what makes those windows more complicated is that when they occur can vary from worker to worker.\n\nApparently the unions are eager to fight for workers, except they want to fight workers who want to leave with their own money.\n\nThe new court case driving union concern is Janus v. AFSCME. The heart of the case is the ability of unions to require government employees to subsidize a union as a condition of working for their government. Unions argue that workers benefit from union negotiations, so it’s only fair that they should pay their share for the representation.\n\nBut the plaintiff in the case argues that requiring any sort of compulsory fee for labor negotiations violates the First Amendment. Labor negotiations are a form of political activity. The debate over the cost and size of government is directly related to negotiations over wages and benefits. So why should anyone be compelled to pay for negotiations they don’t agree with?\n\nThe Supreme Court seemed about to rule against the unions in a similar case in 2015, but then Justice Antonin Scalia died. The court split 4-4. The new make-up of the court might lead to a ruling against the unions.\n\nUnions can still be strong if the court rules against them in Janus. But they will have to convince workers to participate, rather than compelling them to pay for representation they may not want.\n\n18577426', 'Editorial: Unions fight court and to prevent workers from leaving'),

Known as mitigating evidence, such information is supposed to be provided to jurors before they decide whether a capital murder defendant deserves to take responsibility for the crime by being put to death.\n\nDuring a brief presentation in the punishment phase of Ayestas’ trial, the only mitigating evidence presented by defense lawyers came from a Harris County Jail teacher who described the inmate as a serious and attentive student.\n\nRELATED: U.S. Supreme Court takes Ayestas death penalty case\n\nUnless the federal courts reverse their tightfisted policies and provide money for a specialized investigator, defense lawyers say, Ayestas will be executed without any judge or juror hearing evidence that could have resulted in a sentence of life in prison, not death.\n\nThe Texas case “will test our commitment to fair trials,” not only for Ayestas but for other death row inmates, said Brandon Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of the book “End of its Rope: How Killing the Death Penalty Can Revive Criminal Justice.”\n\n‘Catch-22’ situation\n\nThe issue before the Supreme Court revolves around the U.S. Criminal Justice Act, which includes a provision ensuring that indigent death row inmates get court-provided money to hire investigators and experts who are “reasonably necessary” to pursue an appeal.\n\nAyestas requested a mitigation specialist to collect evidence that he argues should have been compiled by his trial lawyers and presented to his jury. That information could provide the evidence needed to show that his trial lawyers were deficient, requiring that Ayestas be given a new sentencing trial and a chance to ask jurors for a life sentence.\n\nAyestas’ request was rejected, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the inmate did not demonstrate a “substantial need” for the expert.\n\nDefense lawyers argue that the 5th Circuit Court’s “substantial need” requirement is improper — providing a tougher hurdle than the “reasonably necessary” standard in federal law — putting inmates in the “Catch-22” situation of having to show a court why the evidence is important before that evidence can be developed.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s top appellate lawyer, Solicitor General Scott Keller, plans to argue that the 5th Circuit Court has adopted a perfectly acceptable standard that mirrors similar legal requirements for death penalty appeals.\n\nThe standard allows judges to weed out weak claims that can drag out death penalty appeals, Texas officials told the Supreme Court in a brief, adding that the standard proposed by Ayestas’ lawyers “provides effectively no limit” on funding requests for appeals.\n\n“Petitioners are not entitled to funding to undertake fishing expeditions to discover claims that may or may not exist,” the Texas brief said.\n\nThe brief also said the lower court properly denied Ayestas’ request for a mitigation specialist.\n\nDefense lawyers must show a “substantial likelihood” that the information about Ayestas’ past would have prompted jurors to give him a life sentence instead of the death penalty, it said. But given the brutal nature of Paneque’s murder and other acts of violence by Ayestas, it is highly unlikely that evidence of mental illness, brain injuries or drug and alcohol abuse in his past would have changed the sentence, the Texas brief argued.\n\nDefense lawyers plan to argue that Texas officials have missed the point.\n\n“Courts do not rewrite statutes,” they told the Supreme Court. The law “means what it says: Courts should authorize services when they are reasonably — not substantially — necessary for the representation.”\n\nTexas death penalty cases\n\nA ruling is expected before the court’s term ends next summer, building on other recent decisions in Texas death penalty cases, including:\n\n• In February, the Supreme Court tossed out the death sentence given to Duane Buck, an African-American, because a defense expert testified at his trial that black men were more likely to commit violence. In a deal with prosecutors, Buck was sentenced to life in prison for capital murder in October after pleading guilty to two additional counts of attempted murder.\n\n• In March, the high court sided with death row inmate Bobby James Moore, ruling that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had ignored scientific advances on how to measure intellectual disabilities, creating “an unacceptable risk” that intellectually disabled Texans will be executed. The Supreme Court ordered the Texas court to re-evaluate Moore’s eligibility for the death penalty using appropriate measures of disability. That review is still underway.\n\n• In June, the Supreme Court ruled against death row inmate Erick Davila, upholding a 5th Circuit Court decision that limited inmates’ ability to challenge the effectiveness of appellate lawyers.\n\nBy far the nation’s most prolific death penalty state, Texas has executed six inmates in 2017 — Arkansas is second nationally with four — and there are four Texas executions scheduled through Jan. 30.', 'Supreme Court reviews another Texas death penalty case'),

She is widely seen as a front-runner for the president’s next appointment to the high court.\n\nSpeaking Thursday on the Senate floor, McConnell, R-Ky., lavished praise on the nominees and vowed swift confirmations.\n\n“President Trump has done a terrific job of nominating judges who are already helping to restore the courts to their intended function in our system of government,” McConnell said. “The nominees we will consider next week are sure to do the same.”\n\nTwo of the nominees, Barrett and Bibas, were subjected to intense criticism by Senate Democrats.\n\nDuring Barrett’s confirmation hearing Sept. 6, several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee suggested that her orthodox religious views would preclude her from effectively discharging her judicial duties. Barrett, a Roman Catholic, has produced scholarship concerning the ethical obligations of Catholic judges.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, argued that Barrett’s writings betray a rigid religious ideologue ill-suited for a judicial post.\n\n“When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you,” Feinstein said. “And that’s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country.”\n\nTwo other Democrats, Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, reiterated her concerns.\n\nFeinstein’s remarks, first reported by The Daily Caller News Foundation, were roundly condemned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, while something of a pro-Barrett cottage industry has promoted novelty items supporting her confirmation.\n\nMcConnell accused Democrats of applying a religious litmus test against the Notre Dame professor.\n\n“Amy Barrett happens to be a nominee who is a Catholic, and who speaks freely and openly about her faith and its importance to her,” McConnell said. “For some on the left, that seems to be a disqualifying factor for her nomination.”\n\nThe Senate majority leader added that he expects Barrett will be confirmed as soon as Monday.\n\nBarrett and Larsen cleared the Judiciary Committee on party line votes Oct. 5.\n\nBibas received similarly coarse treatment from committee Democrats, particularly Durbin. The Illinois Democrat savaged the professor for exploring the merits of corporal punishment in the penal system— including electric shock therapy—in an unpublished 2009 journal article.\n\nBibas has disavowed what he characterizes as an ill-advised thought experiment, and is widely seen as a thoughtful scholar by criminal justice experts across the political spectrum.\n\nStill, Durbin vehemently denounced his nomination.\n\n“Please, before you vote to give this professor a lifetime appointment to the second-highest court in the land, read what he has written and ask yourself the honest question, Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Seriously? Are we going to vote this man into this position?”\n\nThe confirmation votes may go some distance in soothing conservative anxieties about the sluggish pace of judicial confirmations in the early months of the Trump administration.\n\n>>> Commentary: Why Trump’s Appeals Court Nominees Are Backed Up in the Senate\n\nThough the president has named some 50 judicial nominees since taking office Jan. 20, the Senate has confirmed just seven thus far, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Currently, 150 vacancies exist across the federal courts, according to the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n\nElizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation who writes frequently about judicial confirmations and the Supreme Court, called McConnell’s actions encouraging. But Slattery cautioned that Senate Republicans should move at a faster clip, given the scale of the vacancies.\n\n“It’s encouraging to see Majority Leader McConnell follow through on his promise to make judicial nominations a top priority,” she said, adding:\n\nThese four individuals will be excellent additions to the federal bench. But other nominees, like [Minnesota Supreme Court Justice,] David Stras [for the 8th Circuit], are still waiting for a hearing. There’s a lot of work to be done to fill the more than 150 vacancies on our federal courts.\n\nTrump nominated Barrett, Bibas, Eid, and Larsen for vacancies in states with at least one Democratic senator.\n\nThough those Democrats allowed their nominations to proceed by returning “blue slips” to the Judiciary Committee, it isn’t clear whether any of the candidates will win significant support from Democrats.\n\nAll four nominees are expected to win confirmation.\n\n>>> Commentary: McConnell Correct in Seeking to Ditch Blue Slip for Judicial Nominees', 'McConnell Readies Senate Confirmation Votes for 4 Appeals Judges'),

Prior to the gay marriage ruling, these two professors wrote a law review article advocating freedom for both these marriages and for religious conscience, a balancing act they now repeat in the Cakeshop case. Their brief cites the Bible, James Madison (from 1785) and 31 court precedents, posing significant points as follows:\n\nThe baker, Jack Phillips, does not discriminate and gladly serves gay customers except for weddings. Whether or not the state or the gay couple thinks so, the baker sees weddings as “inherently religious,” Colorado demanded participation in what he believes is sin and expected him to “repeatedly violate his conscience or permanently abandon his occupation.”\n\nThen this: Colorado violated not only religious freedom but the “establishment of religion” prohibition, because it forced Phillips’ “participation in a religious exercise,” something the Supreme Court forbids.\n\nYes, the baker’s refusal was an injury to the couple, but “tormenting” a dissenter’s conscience is also an injury. The balance between these conflicting “hardships tilts heavily” toward Phillips because the state ordered him to sacrifice his personal values and identity while the gay spouses “live their own lives by their own values” without interference (and could have found \"ample willing providers\" of cakes elsewhere).\n\nJournalists note: A curious aspect is that Colorado upheld conscience claims on the opposite side when three bakers -- Azucar, Gateaux Ltd., Le Baker Sensual -- refused droll customer requests for specialty cakes to proclaim biblical opposition to gay sex.\n\nWatch www.scotusblog.com for the forthcoming filings to back the gay couple’s cake quest, and mark your calendars for walkups and follow-ups as the high court hears this case December 5.', 'When First Amendment conflicts erupt at US Supreme Court, it\'s time to ask WWDD?'),

Tom Udall Saturday addressed the N.M. NAACP\'s 66th Annual State Conference.\n\nThe following are his remarks as prepared for delivery:\n\nThank you mayor (Ken Miyagishima) for that kind introduction. You have been a positive leader who has helped shape Las Cruces into one of New Mexico\'s best-managed cities with a great quality of life. Thanks for your steady hand.\n\nThank you Dona Ana County NAACP for organizing this year’s conference. And for your contributions to social justice throughout the community.\n\nI want to be sure to recognize your executive director – Curtis Rosemond – who wears many hats. He does double duty as President for this NAACP chapter and President and CEO of the Las Cruces Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In his “spare time,” he’s a partner in VIP Southwest Services and Tours. Curtis, you are a tremendous asset to the Las Cruces community.\n\nThe NAACP local branches are important across New Mexico. Thank you Daniel Johnson for your statewide leadership.\n\nI am truly honored to be part of this conference. Growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, I was inspired by the work of the NAACP. Our country owes an enormous debt to the brilliant legal strategy behind Brown v. Board of Education. Not only did that 1954 case open doors for African American elementary school children, it helped open doors for all of America’s minorities, for women, for people with disabilities, for the LGBT community, for millions of Americans — and for the world.\n\nMy father Stewart and my uncle Mo Udall played a small part in the desegregation effort, which I’m proud of. In 1947, they were both at the University of Arizona. My father was class president at the law school, and my Uncle Mo was student body president.\n\nAt that time, African American students could not eat in the cafeteria on campus. They could order their food there. But then they had to go outside to eat. One day, my father and uncle brought a freshman friend – Morgan Maxwell, Jr. – with them to the cafeteria. They insisted he be allowed to have his meal in the cafeteria. And he did. From that day on, African Americans ate in the cafeteria. According to Morgan Maxwell, the hamburger and milkshake he ate that day were the best he’d ever had.\n\nDecades of work by the NAACP and so many others on behalf of equality in America is being tested in our country now. For the first time in modern memory, we have a president who is building a political base grounded on division, not unity. Exploiting differences among us, rather than celebrating our commonality.\n\nFrom calling Mexican immigrants criminals and “rapists,” to directing a Muslim ban, to insisting on building a wall, to blaming QUOTE “both sides” for Charlottesville, to excoriating NFL players for calling attention to police brutality and racism in America, to leaving Puerto Rico stranded without adequate drinking water, power, and supplies.\n\nWe have seen hatred, bigotry, and even violence unleashed. The Council on American-Islamic Relations reported an alarming 91 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes during the first half of 2017 – compared to the first half of 2016.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported a surge of hate crimes after the 2016 presidential election. It counted almost 900 incidents in the 10 days after the election, over 1,000 in the first month after the election, and over 1,800 from November 9 through March 31.\n\nYes, our nation is being tested.\n\nBut we are steadfast and immoveable. Steadfast in our knowledge that our nation’s diversity has made us strong. And immovable in our belief that all persons are created equal.\n\nLast week, President Obama gave his first major speech since leaving office. He recognized that the politics of division is “not who we are” as a nation. He recognized QUOTE “the goodness of America.”\n\nI agree. The vast majority of Americans soundly reject the politics of division.\n\nIt is up to all of us to act, to stay engaged, and to teach acceptance. It is up to all of us to speak out against hatred and to speak for unity. And it is up to all of us to VOTE.\n\nA disconnect is growing – between what the American people want, and what their elected leaders are giving them. There is something fundamentally wrong when a Republican-controlled House of Representatives passes -- on purely partisan lines -- a health care bill that only 16 percent of the American people support.\n\nThere is something fundamentally wrong when the U.S. House and Senate pass budget resolutions that cut life-saving programs that millions of working class families depend on – while gearing up to give massive tax cuts to the super wealthy and corporations. The top 1 percent.\n\nThis is not how democracy is supposed to work.\n\nA basic problem is that congressional districts do not reflect the collective values of the voters. Congressional districts are gerrymandered racially and by party. And this skews elections.\n\nThink about this. In 2016, Republican candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives received about 49 percent of the total votes – but won 55 percent of the seats. Democratic candidates received 48 percent of the votes – but won less than 45 percent of the races. These margins make a big difference in the balance in the House.\n\nI’m not saying this to make a point about partisan politics. It illustrates that our federal – and state – legislatures do not reflect the views of the voters – Democrat or Republican.\n\nThe NAACP is working hard on this issue. In North Carolina, Virginia, and Texas, federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have voided racially gerrymandered districts. And the Supreme Court has taken up a Wisconsin case testing whether partisan gerrymandering is lawful.\n\nWe also see voter suppression efforts cropping up in states -- like we have not seen in recent times. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to strike down critically needed Voting Rights Act protections will surely embolden others. Voter suppression skews elections.\n\nThe president has his hand in this, too. He appointed his Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. He said the purpose was to ferret out the “millions” of fraudulent votes that lost him the popular vote. But there is no evidence whatsoever of widespread fraud. And lawmakers, election officials, citizen watchdogs, and security experts worry that the commission’s real purpose is to create obstacles to voting for American citizens -- particularly minority, younger, and low-income voters.\n\nLast week, I joined 17 other Senate Democrats to demand answers to why the president’s election commission continues to seek sensitive voter information.\n\nSensitive information that many states – red and blue – and including New Mexico -- have refused to hand over. We questioned why his commission is using a particular data collection program. A federal appellate court condemned this program for targeting QUOTE “African Americans with almost surgical precision” in the North Carolina redistricting effort I mentioned before. The federal appellate court – and later the U.S. Supreme Court -- found that North Carolina engaged in unlawful racial gerrymandering.\n\nIn July, I cosponsored the Anti-Voter Suppression Act, which would repeal the president’s so-called “election integrity” commission. More than 90 members in the Senate and House support this bill -- including every Democratic senator of color.\n\nThe right to vote is sacred. The president’s “election integrity” commission is really a voter suppression commission. And must be called out for what it is.\n\nBut the biggest scourge in our election system is our out-of-control campaign finance system.\n\nUnlimited and undisclosed campaign contributions from the ultra-wealthy and large corporations skew elections. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision opened a Pandora’s box of ways big money can undermine our democracy. I have been fighting Citizens United from the beginning.\n\nLast month, I introduced the bicameral We the People Democracy Reform Act of 2017. That comprehensive legislation addresses democratic and electoral reforms to restore integrity, accountability, and transparency to our broken political system. We the People ends extreme partisan gerrymandering. It increases voter participation and reforms campaign finance laws. And it strengthens lobbying and revolving door laws.\n\nI have copies of a summary of its provisions with me for anyone who would like one.\n\nAs citizens, there is a lot we can do. We can register to vote. We can vote. We can register others to vote. And we can encourage them to vote.\n\nRight here in Dona Ana County, the County Clerk’s Office has partnered with community volunteers to form an Election Advisory Council to build a voting culture. Their first effort is to engage youth. And their goal is to get 100 percent of graduating seniors to register to vote – and to cast their votes.\n\nThe American people are losing faith in our electoral process and democratic institutions. They’ve seen too much evidence that our government doesn’t answer to ordinary citizens.\n\nIt shouldn’t be possible for Congress to pass health care bills that the American people overwhelmingly reject because they would cause millions of people to lose access to health insurance.\n\nIt shouldn’t be possible for Congress to pass federal budgets and tax cuts for the 1 percent – while balancing the books on the backs of working and middle class families, the disadvantaged, children, and seniors.\n\nPresident Obama said in his recent speech, QUOTE “The most important office is the office of citizen.” He’s right. Together, we can get our democracy back on track.', 'Udall Speaks At NM NAACP State Conference'),

It is the third time a case from the county has arrived before the Supreme Court this year.\n\n\"That tells you that there is a problem,\" said Robert Dunham, Executive Director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\n\"When you have three outlier practices in one jurisdiction in one year, it begins to look like a renegade county as opposed to just an outlier county.\"\n\n- Lack of expertise -\n\nThe American penal code stipulates a defendant has the right to counsel and \"reasonable necessary\" means for his or her defense -- in particular to fund investigations likely to establish mitigating circumstances.\n\nBut in the case of Ayestas, the \"trial counsel didn\'t do anything for almost a year and a half, until about a month before trial,\" according to Lee Kovarksy, who is arguing the case before the Supreme Court.\n\n\"A reasonable lawyer is supposed to look into this person\'s social history, get a mental health profile and figure out what the most effective mitigation case will be. None of that happens here.\"\n\nOnce Ayestas\' guilt was established, he added, it should have been asked whether someone like him belongs \"in the category of the worst of the worst.\"\n\n\"Do they deserve the death penalty in light of the circumstances in which they lived their life?\" Kovarsky said.\n\nHis view was echoed by Brandon Garett, professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\n\"The main job of a defense lawyer in a death penalty case is to give the jury a reason not to sentence someone to death,\" he said.\n\n- No reason not to sentence -\n\nFor Ayestas, he added, it was \"no surprise that the jury took 12 minutes to decide whether to sentence him to death.\"\n\n\"They had no reason to consider not to sentence him to death.\"\n\nIn order to challenge a person\'s detention following poor legal defense in the United States, a petition for habeas corpus can be filed -- arguing the person was detained against their constitutional rights.\n\nBut in Texas, the law complicates things for prisoners -- requiring lawyers to prove the sentence would have been different if the defendant had been better represented.\n\n\"You need a team to do capital defense. A lawyer alone is not enough,\" says Emily Olson-Gault -- director and chief counsel at the American Bar Association\'s Death Penalty Representation Project.\n\nSuch a team should include social workers, as well as investigators and funding for medical experts -- all of which were denied to Ayestas by the state of Texas.\n\nThese lawyers hope the Supreme Court will back the defense\'s argument that Ayestas was denied \"reasonable necessary\" means to investigate possible mitigating evidence.\n\nJuries in the past have been receptive to arguments related to mental health, even when faced with the most barbaric crimes.\n\nIn the case of James Holmes -- who opened fire in a Colorado movie theater 2012, killing 12 and wounding 70 -- evidence of dementia persuaded a jury to forego the the death penalty.', 'Poor legal defense the spotlight in death penalty case before the US Supreme Court'),
(207, 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/politics/peace-cross-maryland-court-first-amendment.html', 'nytimes', 'Emily Baumgaertner', '2017-10-29', 'In a 2-to-1 ruling, the three-judge panel declared that the Peace Cross violated the First Amendment by having “a primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government and religion.”\n\nDouglas Laycock, a religious liberties scholar and professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, praised the decision.\n\nThe cross “asserts the truth of one religion and, implicitly but necessarily, the falsehood of all other religions,” he said. “Its secondary meanings, as in honoring war dead, are entirely derivative of its primary meaning as a symbol of the Resurrection.”\n\nIf the Fourth Circuit denies a request for the full court to reconsider the panel’s decision, defenders of the monument vow to take the case to the Supreme Court. They argue that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent, threatening national treasures such as the 24-foot Canadian Cross of Sacrifice and 13-foot Argonne Cross in Arlington National Cemetery — both within the Fourth Circuit’s jurisdiction — as well as the ground zero “cross,” the steel beams discovered among World Trade Center debris now on display in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.\n\n“It is brooding hostility toward religion, a sort of cleansing,” said Kelly Shackelford, the president of First Liberty Institute, one of the legal groups aiding the American Legion in defending the cross. “We would immediately need to begin massive bulldozing and sandblasting of veterans memorials across the country in a way that most people would find inconceivable.”\n\nIn his Fourth Circuit dissent, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory, first appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued that the Establishment Clause “does not require the government ‘to purge from the public sphere’ any reference to religion.”\n\nSupporters of the cross also argue that context is vital: The Peace Cross is displayed alongside an American flag, amid a park of memorials for veterans of various wars. Its four sides, they say, are marked prominently with patriotic, not religious, virtues: valor, endurance, courage and devotion. The fallen soldiers are listed on a tablet with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut opponents say it is hardly integrated: No other monument in the area is taller than 10 feet, and there are no other religious symbols in the park. They note that its fallen soldiers’ names are rusted away and obscured by bushes. And the cross has been the site of prayer gatherings as well as Veterans Day vigils — and even such vigils are often opened in prayer.\n\nTwo past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

After pushback, they had modified the exhibits to include Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and other historical documents, arguing that the Ten Commandments were similarly influential in the development of Western legal thought.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose. Michael W. McConnell, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford, calls such displays “triumphalism — a flavor of who is top dog.”\n\nIn a second case, Thomas Van Orden v. Rick Perry, the court allowed carvings of the Ten Commandments in a Texas State Capitol monument that had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a primarily secular group, in 1961. The court cited the donor’s lack of religious intent.\n\nIn his Van Orden opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who cast the swing vote in both cases, called the historical factor alone “determinative”: The monument had stood since 1961 without controversy.\n\nThe Peace Cross, also donated by a secular group, is almost twice as old as the monument in that case, and has been on public property for a comparable span. If the Supreme Court reviews this one, Mr. McConnell believes it will be squarely governed by Justice Breyer’s opinion.\n\n“I think they thought they were putting this kind of case to rest with Van Orden,” said Mr. McConnell, who has also served as a judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. “Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didn’t get the memo.”\n\n“I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuit’s decision quite surprising. If the Supreme Court were to grant review, the likelihood is very high that it would be reversed.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Peace Cross opponents argue that there is a stark difference between the Ten Commandments and a cross — namely, the figures each represents.\n\n“The court pointed out that Moses was a lawmaker as well as a religious leader,” said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the American Humanist Association, who argued the case in the Fourth Circuit. “There were connections to the nation’s history of lawmakers that made the Ten Commandments overall less religious than an enormous, free-standing Latin cross that unequivocally represents Christianity.”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s thinking on displays of the cross is murky.\n\nIn Salazar v. Buono, a 2010 decision regarding a cross-shaped war memorial in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, six justices wrote distinct opinions. In 2011, when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal regarding a series of highway memorial crosses for fallen police officers in Utah, Justice Clarence Thomas’s 19-page dissent argued that the court had rejected “an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles.”\n\nAwaiting its fate, the Peace Cross stands with a tarp draped neatly across the top, where the concrete has begun to crumble. Elizave Mordan, the King Pawn manager, can see it from her shop.\n\n“We heard they may be taking it down, and I disagree with that. It just doesn’t bother anybody around here,” she said as she sorted through used power tools, record players and antique jewelry for sale.\n\n“I worry nobody is going to remember them,” she said of the 49 fallen soldiers. “You can’t remember something you cannot see.”', 'A 40-Foot Cross Has Honored War Dead for 90 Years.

Signers include such well-known culinary celebrities as Jose Andres, Anthony Bourdain, Tom Colicchio, Carla Hall, Padma Lakshmi and Christina Tosi.\n\nThe brief says, in part, that the First Amendment “does not allow a chef, baker, or other culinary artist to refuse to provide a generally offered service based on the identity of the customer.” When a chef offers something to the public, the brief says, “he must offer it to all.” And there is no basis in the law, the brief says, to recognize an exception for wedding cakes.\n\nMike Wiley, winner of the 2017 James Beard Best Chef: Northeast award, said he signed onto the brief when he learned of it from a new employee who had received a copy from friends.

Each issue raised by Flowers is without merit. Flowers’ four convictions for capital murder and sentences to death were properly decided by the jury, and we affirm.\"\n\nIn addition to Coleman, Justices Dawn Beam, Mike Randolph, James Maxwell and Robert Chamberlin voted to affirm Flowers\' convection.\n\nChief Justice William Waller Jr., Leslie King, Jim Kitchens and David Ishee opposed upholding Flowers\' conviction and death sentence.\n\n\"I find plain error in the prosecution’s mischaracterizations, particularly given our admonishments in Flowers II,\" Waller said of misstatements to the jury. \"Therefore, I would reverse the judgment in this case and remand for a new trial.\"\n\nKing wrote in a separate dissenting opinion that he couldn\'t say Flowers received a fair trial.\n\n\"The State presented insufficient evidence to meet its burden,\" King wrote. \"The most that may be said in this case is that the jury could speculate that Flowers committed one of the murders to avoid arrest. There was no evidence that he did. In fact, the State argued in the guilt phase that Flowers committed the murders for different purposes: revenge and anger over being fired as well as to effectuate the robbery. From its opening statement, the state’s theory of the case was that Flowers possessed a motive to commit the murders because he had been fired by Tardy’s. This motive — a revenge killing — is at odds with a conclusion that he killed out of a necessity to avoid arrest. No evidence was presented that Flowers expressed an intent to kill to avoid arrest.\"\n\nIn May of last year, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, refused Flowers\' motion to force District Attorney Doug Evans to turn over law enforcement and prosecution files in his case as well as Evans\' notes, jury strike sheets and other documents relating to jury selection in Flowers\' sixth trial.\n\nAfter Flowers\' conviction in 2010, Circuit Judge Joseph Loper Jr. issued a 42-page opinion denying Flowers\' motion to throw out the jury verdict, or, as an alternative grant him a new trial. The state Supreme Court affirmed Flowers\' conviction. However, Flowers filed a new post-conviction appeal, citing prosecutoral misconduct.\n\nFlowers\' attorney, David Voisin, said normally there is presumption that the prosecution has fully disclosed all information.\n\n\"Ordinarily, we presume that public officials have properly discharged their duties. However, this is no ordinary case,\" Voisin said in the motions. \"Instead, the lengthy and tortured history of this case includes an extensive history of prosecutorial misconduct, to be detailed in petitioner\'s forthcoming petition for post-conviction relief.\"\n\nThe state Supreme Court reversed Flowers\' conviction three previous times.\n\nFlowers, 47, was first convicted in 1997 for killing Bertha Tardy and then in 1999 for killing Derrick Stewart. He received the death penalty in both trials, but the state Supreme Court reversed the convictions on appeal.\n\nIn 2004, Flowers was tried when all four killings were consolidated into one trial, and he again received the death penalty. The Supreme Court reversed that decision as well.\n\nFlowers\' next two trials ended in mistrials, one in 2007 and the other in September 2008.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2017/11/02/state-high-court-upholds-curtis-giovanni-flowers-last-conviction-and-death-sentence/826435001/', 'State high court upholds Curtis Giovanni Flowers\' last conviction and death sentence'),

All these tricks to talk to people and convince them of things.”\n\nThat led him to his next stop, law school in Boulder, Colorado, where he became intrigued by telecommunications and technology law and had Neil Gorsuch as his anti-trust law professor, just before Gorsuch was appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\n“He was really inspirational,” said Park. “Every day he showed up for class he expected us to prepare for class and to do our best. I would read the material and thought I understood it but he had a way of really showing the depths of it. I was disappointed when he left in the middle of class to go to the Supreme Court.”\n\nWhen he passed his exam and was ready to be sworn into the Colorado Bar, Park wrote his former professor and asked him to do the honors, which he did in his new digs at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“Being sworn in at the Supreme Court, under a portrait of Chief Justice Taft, the only man to be President and Chief Justice, felt surreal,” he said. “It still feels surreal. It was very special and it is not something I will ever forget.”\n\nPark grew up in Gilroy where he attended Luigi Aprea Elementary, Brownell Middle School and graduated from Gilroy High class of 2009.

We want the Supreme Court to hear that loud and clear,\" he told FOX 13.\n\nKitchen was the lead plaintiff in a landmark lawsuit against the state of Utah that led to the ban on same-sex marriage being overturned. Biskupski is the first openly gay mayor in Salt Lake City and married last year.\n\n\"This isn’t just about a cake or a suit or whatever product you may be providing somebody. At the end of the day, this is about a neighbor or a community member and not rejecting them based on simply who they are,\" Kitchen said.\n\nThe case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in December. Owner Jack Phillips refused to make a wedding cake for David Mullins and Charlie Craig, citing his religious objection to same-sex marriage. Colorado sided with the couple and ruled Masterpiece Cakeshop violated the state\'s public accommodation laws, which forbid discrimination based on race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nMany powerful entities in Utah have taken an interest in the case.

I just wanted to support it.\" Staff photo by Derek Davis Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →\n\nThe “Chefs for Equality” brief was filed Monday, according to the Human Rights Campaign, and is signed by 222 chefs, bakers and restaurateurs from every state. Signers include such well-known culinary celebrities as Jose Andres, Anthony Bourdain, Tom Colicchio, Carla Hall, Padma Lakshmi and Christina Tosi.\n\nThe brief says, in part, that the First Amendment “does not allow a chef, baker, or other culinary artist to refuse to provide a generally offered service based on the identity of the customer.” When a chef offers something to the public, the brief says, “he must offer it to all.” And there is no basis in the law, the brief says, to recognize an exception for wedding cakes.\n\nMike Wiley, winner of the 2017 James Beard Best Chef: Northeast award, said he signed onto the brief when he learned of it from a new employee who had received a copy from friends. Wiley is co-owner of Hugo’s, Eventide Oyster Co. and The Honey Paw. The employee, Katharine Marsh, is the former head chef at The Spotted Pig, a celebrated restaurant in New York City.\n\n“She’s moved to Maine with her wife and is working full time at Hugo’s,” Wiley said.\n\nMarsh signed the brief and asked Wiley if he were interested, Wiley recalled. The chef said he was “surprised and disappointed” to learn that all states were represented in the brief but Maine.\n\n“It was right in line with my politics, and so I thought why not?” he said.\n\nWendy Larson, the chef-owner of Slates Restaurant & Bakery in Hallowell, signed on after Betsy Sweet, a progressive activist who is running for governor, called and asked her if she would. Larson’s bakery makes the occasional wedding cake, but does not specialize in them.\n\n“I don’t believe in discrimination against anybody,” she said. “Human rights is very big to me. I just wanted to support it, and I felt like Hallowell should be represented.”\n\nRobert Brown, innkeeper at the Rockmere Lodge in Ogunquit, is also listed as a signer, but contacted Thursday, he said he had “no idea” how his name got on the document.\n\nThe wedding cake case dates back to 2012, when Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., refused to sell a couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, a personally designed cake for their reception. Phillips offered to sell them a pre-made cake, and told them he also does not make Halloween cakes because of his religious convictions. Phillips claims to be protected by his religious beliefs and the First Amendment; the couple, represented by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, calls it discrimination.\n\nThe ‘Chefs for Equality’ brief was written by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, an international law firm headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 5.\n\nMeredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: MeredithGoad\n\nShare\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

State courts say precedent doesn’t allow them to rule, and federal courts say they won’t take action until the state courts do something.\n\nThe case involves Rose Mary Knick, a woman who lives alone on about 90 acres of Pennsylvania land that has been in her family for nearly half a century.\n\nOfficials in Scott Township, which includes her land, abruptly decided to create a law taking away the private property rights of landowners if anyone even thought there was an old gravesite there.\n\nNo proof was necessary for the law to then require that the landowner provide daily public access for anyone to trespass.\n\nKnick is asking the high court to overturn the law as a violation of her property rights, as protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“Scott Township’s graveyard law forces property owners to allow warrantless searches by government and unbridled trespassing by the public,” said Pacific Legal Foundation Senior Attorney J. David Breemer. “The Supreme Court should take Ms. Knick’s case to make sure the township does not get away with its flagrant abridgement of constitutionally protected rights.”\n\n“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today!\n\nHer land is used for a farm and grazing for cattle, horses and other animals. It’s bounded by fences, stone walls and “No Trespassing” signs.\n\n“There is no cemetery mentioned in the chain of title going back hundreds of years,” said the PLF, which has won numerous property rights fights at the Supreme Court already.\n\n“Nevertheless, in 2013, a town enforcement officer entered the property searching for graveyards. Soon after, Ms. Knick was issued a notice of violation claiming her property contained an old burial ground that had not been kept open to the public. She later received a second notice of violation.”\n\nKnick said: “It was unbelievable that the town would trample all over my rights this way, making it open season for trespassing on my land. I am very hopeful that the Supreme Court will take a stand for the Constitution, and for everybody’s property rights, by striking down this outrageous law.”\n\nIsolated grave sites are not uncommon in parts of the country where there is no ban on burials on private ground. And, indeed, sometimes burials date back to before rules and regulations were in place. So the plains of Pennsylvania do, in fact, contain small burial plots for families and such.\n\nHowever, the records simply don’t show any such location on Knick’s land, PLF said.\n\nThe township simply adopted procedures for its “code enforcement” agents to search her land without permission, and while trespassing, they claimed to have found stone evidence of burial plots.\n\nThe lower courts then decided the township had created a “right-of-way” for the public.\n\nThe township issued her citations, but when the arguments began in state court, suddenly withdrew them. The state court then said it couldn’t make a decision until an enforcement action was pending.\n\nWhen Knick then went to federal court, the judge there claimed an adjudication in state court was required first.\n\n“What a mess,” the petition to the high court said. “The Constitution requires a ‘reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation.’ But this is exactly what [precedent] prevents. It creates a chaotic and unworkable system for adjudicating federal takings claims.”\n\n“Pacific Legal Foundation fights for individual liberty, a core component of which is protection from unconstitutional government intrusion on one’s property and privacy,” said PLF President Steven D. Anderson.\n\n“Defending property rights also means insisting that landowners who have suffered constitutional wrongs have direct access to federal court for redress. Securing these protections requires determination and vigilance, and we look forward to vindicating these vital principles.”\n\nThe demand for access to Knick’s land came after an anonymous “citizen inquiry” claimed there was a burial ground there.\n\n“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution.

(KELO.com) -- The South Dakota Retailers Association (SDRA) has filed an amicus brief in ­­­support of the State of South Dakota’s petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit a case that seeks fair sales tax collections.\n\nUnder a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Quill Corp v. North Dakota, out-of-state sellers are not required to collect or remit sales tax on purchases unless they have nexus – a physical presence – in the state in which the purchase is delivered.\n\nIn an attempt to change this precedent, South Dakota lawmakers passed Senate Bill (SB) 106 in 2016, requiring out-of-state retailers to collect and remit tax on purchases shipped to customers in the state. The South Dakota Retailers Association was instrumental in the passage of the law, which has been working its way through the court system since its enactment.\n\nOn October 2nd, Attorney General Marty Jackley filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. SDRA’s brief in support of the State highlights the Association’s history on the issue and why the organization believes the Court should take up the case.\n\n“SDRA has a long history of defending our members from unfair competition,” stated SDRA Board President Gary Cammack. “Our participation in this lawsuit is part of our ongoing commitment to making sure everyone is competing by the same playbook, something we’ve been fighting for since our organization was founded in 1897.”\n\nThe state of South Dakota and municipalities lose an estimated $50 million annually in sales tax revenue due to these untaxed sales. But Cammack noted that the impact of the outdated tax goes far beyond government revenue. He said giving out-of-state companies a tax break encourages customers to spend their cash out of state, which can impact everyone in a community.\n\n“Before a local retailer even opens their doors, they are placed at up to a 6.5% disadvantage because of this tax differential,” he said. “When that retailer loses business, it means they have less money for salaries, less money to give to the local sports teams, and less to contribute to community causes. Everyone loses out.”\n\nCammack said the Association is hopeful the Court will agree it is time to revisit the issue and finally resolve it.', 'SD continues the online tax fight'),

The political districts were so skewed in the Republican’s favor they won a supermajority in the assembly even after losing the popular vote in 2012. In this case, seemingly countless democratic votes didn’t “count” because they were so packed and cracked into conservative districts their voices were lost completely.\n\nPolitical gerrymandering occurs when a party draws district lines to benefit their own party. This means both Republicans and Democrats can be guilty of it, yet the Supreme Court case sparking conversation right now is Gill v. Whitford, which challenges the 2011 redrawing of Wisconsin’s state legislative map by Republican lawmakers. The districts were manipulated with computer models and voting data to redraw political boundaries.\n\nOur representative system in America has been manipulated into a political tool parties use to shape districts in their favor. Unfortunately, our voting system has become less and less representative of the actual people and more and more shaped to favor party interests. The manipulation was so extreme, the federal district court found, that it violated the “one person, one vote” principle and the democratic voters’ rights to fair representation required by the Constitution’s promises of equal protection. Virtually, Democratic voters’ votes didn’t count.\n\nA look at SCOTUS’s upcoming Wisconsin gerrymandering caseThe United States Supreme Court granted a hearing Monday that will decide if Wisconsin Republicans acted unconstitutionally when drawing their Read…\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has tried to evade cases about gerrymandering, as districting is a power entrusted to the legislative branch, not the judicial branch. However, it is the court’s duty to check clear oversteps of power which is precisely what the Wisconsin Republican legislature is guilty of. The landmark case could greatly change the way the nation’s elections work.\n\nThose who benefit from this, the legislators, have no incentive to fix this problem, which is why it is crucial that the higher court intervenes when such a threat to democracy is rampant. In the three elections since the redistricting, Democrats have never won more than 39 of the 99 seats, even when they won a majority of the votes cast statewide for assembly candidates. With such an advantage, why would the legislators ever want to end the system that makes them immune to being voted out?\n\nGerrymandering should not be a partisan issue, especially because either side can be harmed by it. No matter which way an individual leans, they have a right to be heard in our democracy. Even high-profile Republicans like Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona and Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio stand with Democrats against the threat gerrymandering poses to democracy.\n\nWithin the case, the main legal arguments focus on the Constitutional violation of equal protection and free expression, as voters packed into skewed districts have less of a voice in the political process and are arguably penalized for their party affiliation. Moreover, extreme gerrymandering can undercut the democratic competition, they argue, which weakens public faith in government and lawmakers are not encouraged to make compromises.\n\nThe bipartisan briefs include research that shows that several sets of alternative maps demonstrated that the appellants could have achieved their valid redistricting goals without handicapping either party’s supporters. Based on this, arguments that insist it is impossible to draw fair districts are simply unfounded.\n\nUW political scientists discuss problematic effects of gerrymanderingThe Madison Institute held a lecture Thursday to discuss the implications and effect of gerrymandering in the Whitford v. Gill Read…\n\nThe legislators used a powerful new gerrymandering tool, based on sophisticated computer modeling and the public must be protected from this invasive new technology. One of the key aspects of democracy is electing officials to represent the people. However, those in office secured their seats by stripping Wisconsin voters’ voices.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court’s conservative wing will most likely argue that judges should stay out of redistricting, this is a landmark case that sparks conversation about an important issue. For America’s sake, let’s hope that the Court rules to end gerrymandering in a government that is supposedly by the people and for the people — not for politicians who have no right to be in office.\n\nClaudia Koechell ([email protected]) is a sophomore majoring in history and political science.

The British Columbia firm charged that a group of Equustek distributors (known as the Datalink defendants) were selling counterfeit Equustek products online.\n\nDatalink continued to sell these goods globally, even after the court ordered it to stop, prompting Equustek to ask Google to intervene.

Circuit ruled in favor of an undocumented pregnant 17-year-old who has been fighting in the courts for the right to leave a government-funded detention facility in Texas to have an abortion.\n\nOn Oct. 25, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which was representing the teen in court, announced that she had had an abortion early that morning.\n\nA few weeks before the arguments in federal court, the 17-year-old received a state judicial order granting her permission to have an abortion without parental consent, which is required by Texas state law.\n\nThe teen arrived in the United States illegally as an unaccompanied minor, which put her under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

In light of that, the Justice Department believes the judgment under review should be vacated, and discipline may be warranted against Jane Doe’s attorneys,\" said Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley.\n\nIn its latest court filing, the administration argued that while the teen\'s lawyers have a duty to \"zealously advocate\" on behalf of their client, \"They also have duties to this Court and to the Bar.\"\n\nGovernment attorneys wrote that it \"appears under the circumstances that those duties may have been violated, and that disciplinary action may therefore be warranted.\"\n\nThe ACLU accused the administration of failing to file a timely appeal to the Supreme Court and taking the \"extraordinary step of seeking to vacate a lower court ruling protecting reproductive rights,\" in a statement in response to the administration\'s petition.\n\n\"This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion.

A rewrite of Louisiana law earlier this year is expected to bring the matter back into court, both sides agree.\n\nAccording to the advocacy group\'s data, Louisiana district attorneys are trying to block - and in some cases have succeeded in blocking -- about a third of the juvenile murderers in Louisiana who would qualify for a parole hearing after serving 25 years in prison and finishing educational programming.\n\nThe Supreme Court had said juveniles should only be sentenced to life without parole in rare and extreme cases where the minor is considered the \"worst of the worst\" and cannot be rehabilitated. Jill Pasquarella, an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children\'s Rights, said it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in Louisiana would meet the Supreme Court\'s \"worst of the worst\" definition.\n\nPasquarella said the prosecutors\' challenge of so many juvenile lifers\' parole eligibility means Louisiana will be headed back to court, costing the cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands more dollars. Louisiana not only has to pay for a second defense of the state law, it also pays for some of the lawyers who represent juvenile lifers in such cases.\n\nPete Adams, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, doesn\'t dispute that Louisiana is probably headed back to court. He said the Supreme Court will have to add more clarity to the term \"worst of the worst\" in regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n\"Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court will say what\'s acceptable and what\'s not,\" Adams said. \"If the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can\'t get it, we will abide by that.\"\n\nNot all district attorneys are happy that they are being brought into this fight over juvenile lifers, many of whom have been in prison for decades. Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzarro said he would have preferred if the Legislature had not involved prosecutors in the decision about whether the juvenile lifers should have access to parole.\n\nCannizzarro said the Department of Corrections, where the parole board is housed, is in a much better position to determine whether many of these juvenile murderers should be parole eligible or not.\n\n\"We\'re basically guessing on these cases,\" Cannizzaro said in an interview Friday afternoon. \"I think this is an unfair call for the district attorney.\"\n\nCannizzarro\'s office reviewed 64 cases regarding juvenile murderers, more than any other district attorney in the state. He\'s filed motions to potentially block parole eligibility in 32 of those cases. But several of the cases are quite old -- spanning from the early 1970s to 2007, he said. Cannizzarro, who became district attorney in 2008, wasn\'t in office when any of them were tried.\n\n\"We are trying to make the best decision that we can without really seeing this person,\" he said. \"I think it puts an unfair burden on the district attorneys.\"\n\nFour of Cannizzarro\'s 32 objections to juvenile lifers\' parole eligibility may eventually be dropped; they were only filed because Cannizzarro was afraid his office didn\'t have enough information about the offender yet. The other 28 he decided to oppose because of objections from the victims\' families, survivors of the crime or concerns from former prosecutors who tried the cases. He\'s also seeking to block parole for any offender who has had a poor disciplinary record in prison.\n\nCannizzarro said he believes that a juvenile murderer could mature into an adult that no longer poses a threat to society, but he thinks the Department of Corrections is in a better position to know if a person has changed. \"I do recognize, that over the course of time, that a person might change,\" he said.\n\nHe declined to explain why then he was trying to block the parole board, which is housed in the Department of Corrections, from getting opportunity to decide whether a person should be released in at least 28 cases. The parole board also considers victim opposition, law enforcement concern and prison disciplinary records before granting parole.\n\nCannizzarro\'s position is also at odds with what the district attorneys association fought for during the spring legislative session. The DA\'s group lobbied for the right to block juvenile lifers from getting parole access, which is the main reason it was included in the new law.\n\nPrior to the law change that took place this summer, Louisiana had already been told twice in the past five years by the Supreme Court that the way it handles juveniles convicted of murder was not sufficient. Louisiana and other states had to give people who committed murder before they were adults more opportunities to be released, even if they have spent decades in prison.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by a prisoner in Alabama that states had to offer some parole opportunity to people convicted for murders they committed as juveniles. The justices said juvenile murderers, in particular, should be given access to parole because science shows they haven\'t fully matured and are more likely to make poor decisions. In other words, people who commit serious crimes, even murder, as children are more likely to experience personal growth.\n\nLouisiana responded to the ruling by creating access to parole for juvenile lifers only if they were sentenced after 2012, but not for those who were already in prison at the time. That law was challenged by a juvenile lifer already in a Louisiana prison and, in 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that Louisiana has to give juvenile lifers who had already been locked up a shot at parole.\n\nThis led to a complicated rewrite of the Louisiana law governing juvenile lifers in the 2017 legislative session. Juvenile lifers now have a shot at parole starting this month after they\'ve served 25 years and meeting some other requirements, such as earning a high school diploma equivalent. However, the new law allows prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer\'s access to parole through a special court hearing.\n\nDistrict attorneys had between Aug. 1 and Oct. 30 to file notice for those special hearings. The Louisiana Center for Children\'s Rights has determined that prosecutors have filed notice to challenge parole access for a third of these cases, including the 32 that Cannizzarro mentioned in Orleans.\n\nState Sen. Dan Claitor, R-Baton Rouge, said he isn\'t prepared to say whether the new Louisiana law governing juvenile lifers goes far enough until he sees data from an official source showing the impact of prosecutor challenges. But Claitor, who sponsored this year\'s revised juvenile lifer legislation, conceded the numbers didn\'t look great.\n\n\"I would have to agree -- if those numbers are correct -- it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,\" Claitor said. \"I just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.\"\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nJulia O\'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.

Even so, they argued, the appeals court decision “should not be left on the books,” where it could help in legal battles by teens in a similar situation.\n\nThe ACLU has vowed to continue related litigation challenging Trump administration policies that block unaccompanied immigrants from having an abortion while in U.S. custody.\n\n“We will not stop fighting until we have justice for every young woman like Jane,” Cole said.\n\nThe government’s petition to the Supreme Court argued that Doe was allowed to have an abortion based on a misguided ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That ruling should be overturned, they argued, because the government should not be forced to facilitate an abortion for unaccompanied minors in custody after unlawfully entering the United States.\n\nBut in a statement accompanying last week’s ruling, Justice Patricia Millett, who was part of the appeals court majority, said it was “unclear why undocumented status should change everything” in Doe’s case.\n\n“Surely the mere act of entry into the United States without documentation does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her or his own. Nor can the sanction for unlawful entry be forcing a child to have a baby,” Millett wrote.\n\nDoe’s case was closely watched for its potential impact on two contentious issues — access to abortion and immigration policy — and Paxton had greeted news of Doe’s abortion by saying he was profoundly disappointed that the Trump administration allowed the procedure to take place without a Supreme Court challenge.\n\nOn Friday, Paxton said he supported the appeal, saying it was clear that “ACLU lawyers misled the Department of Justice in order to carry out this heinous act against an innocent unborn life.”', 'Trump lawyers seek to reignite legal fight over Jane Doe\'s abortion'),

The administration is now asking the Supreme Court to vacate a lower court ruling in favor of the teen, who entered the country illegally and is being held in a federal facility for unaccompanied minors in Texas. The 17-year-old had an abortion on Oct. 25 after the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in her favor.

The shelter did not assist her, citing a new government policy that they offer life-affirming support to women and girls who are pregnant, according to Slate.\n\nAccording to the report, the shelter took “Jane Doe” to a pro-life pregnancy resource center instead. The ACLU said the teen did not change her mind after receiving counseling, and scheduled an abortion; however, the shelter where she is staying refused to transport her to the appointment.\n\nThe ACLU sued on behalf of the teen, and after a series of appeals by the U.S. government and the ACLU, the pro-abortion legal group won in federal appeals court.

He said some of the buildings he bought had 100 violations before he repaired and rented them out.\n\nKahn is not the only landlord to face license revocation proceedings by the city. Last month an administrative hearing officer issued an opinion that city regulators could strip about 60 rental licenses from Stephen Frenz, who they contend repeatedly failed to disclose that controversial landlord Spiros Zorbalas continued to have an ownership interest in his properties.

(AP Photo/Bob Child, File) The Associated Press\n\nBy DAVE COLLINS, Associated Press\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — When Gov. Dannel P. Malloy makes his pick for the next Connecticut chief justice, the Democrat will have nominated six of the seven people serving on the state\'s highest court — a rare feat in the history of the governorship.\n\nLawyers and other legal affairs observers say the court is rarely partisan, focusing mostly on interpretations of state law that often result in 7-0 rulings.\n\nOccasionally, though, a case comes along that exposes an ideological rift, as it did in a 4-3 ruling that abolished the state\'s death penalty in 2015 when the majority and minority criticized each other in dueling opinions. Two cases currently before the court may also expose such a rift — a lawsuit against gunmaker Remington Arms in connection with the 2012 Newtown school massacre and a lawsuit challenging the way the state funds local education.\n\n\"They\'re not as controversial as you see at the federal level,\" said Proloy Das, a Hartford-based lawyer who chairs the appellate practice group at the Murtha Cullina law firm. \"Our values aren\'t all that different across the state.\"\n\nDas and other observers say the biggest impact of the Malloy nominations may be increased diversity on the court.\n\nMalloy-nominated Justices Richard Robinson and Raheem Mullins are black. Newly appointed Justice Maria Araujo Kahn is one of two full-time female justices, joining soon-to-be-retiring Chief Justice Chase Rogers, who was nominated by Republican former Gov. M. Jodi Rell. And Justice Andrew McDonald, also picked by Malloy, is the court\'s first openly gay member.\n\n\"What distinguishes the Malloy court is diversity, as opposed to any particular ideological or philosophical lineup,\" said Timothy Fisher, dean of the University of Connecticut School of Law. \"You\'ve got a lot of different knowledge bases and experience bases to draw from.\"\n\nExperts note that two Malloy nominees to the Supreme Court, Robinson and Kahn, were first nominated as lower court judges by Republican former Govs. John Rowland and Rell, respectively.

With the departure of Rogers, the governor gets his first chance to nominate a chief justice.\n\nThe last governor to nominate so many justices was Democratic Gov. William O\'Neill, who picked 10 justices during his tenure from 1980 to 1991.\n\nWhen asked about Malloy getting to nominate six of the seven justices on the court, Connecticut Republican Party Chairman J.R.

Madison was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer in 1985.\n\nMadison understands he is being executed for a murder, but he doesn’t recall the crime or the trial, according to a psychologist hired by his lawyer. A concurrence by Justice Stephen G. Breyer summarized Madison’s issues.\n\nMadison “has lived nearly half of his life on death row,” Breyer said. “During that time, he has suffered severe strokes, which caused vascular dementia and numerous other significant physical and mental problems. He is legally blind. His speech is slurred. He cannot walk independently. He is incontinent. His disability leaves him without a memory of his commission of a capital offense.”\n\nIn 2016, Madison sought to suspend his death sentence due to his memory lapses.\n\nA trial judge in Alabama ruled against Madison, saying he failed to show that he suffered from a mental illness that makes him unable to rationally understand he is being executed as punishment for a crime. The standard was established in two Supreme Court cases.\n\nMadison sought habeas relief. A federal judge said the state court had correctly applied precedent and didn’t make an unreasonable determination entitling him to relief, a required showing for habeas appeals under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\n\nThe Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that because Madison has no memory of his offense, it inescapably follows that he doesn’t understand the connection between his crime and execution.\n\nIn a per curiam opinion (PDF), the Supreme Court said the 11th Circuit was wrong. Supreme Court precedent has not clearly established that “a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment,” the court said.\n\nThe high court said it was ruling based on the deferential standard given state court determinations established by the AEDPA. “We express no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context,” the Supreme Court said.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred in an opinion joined by Breyer and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She said the issue in the case warrants a “full airing,” but the court is constrained by the AEDPA.\n\nBreyer wrote a separate concurrence. Madison is 67 years old and is “one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,” Breyer said. The average time on death row for the 21 people executed this year was 19 years, he said.\n\nThe trend could bring more cases to the court involving “state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age,” Breyer added. “And we may well have to consider the ways in which lengthy periods of imprisonment between death sentence and execution can deepen the cruelty of the death penalty while at the same time undermining its penological rationale. …\n\n“Rather than develop a constitutional jurisprudence that focuses upon the special circumstances of the aged, however, I believe it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the problem—the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.”\n\nBreyer first called for a review or the constitutionality of the death penalty in a lethal injection case in 2015.\n\nThe case decided Monday is Dunn v.

Both times juries returned verdicts in favor of Apple—the first ordering Samsung to pay more than $1 billion in damages, the second ordering a payment of $120 million.\n\nNews today concerns the second verdict. In 2016, the $120 million verdict was thrown out entirely by a panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals. The judges said that patents on Apple features like smartphone autocorrect and \"slide to unlock\" were invalid in light of prior art.\n\nFurther Reading The jury is in: Samsung infringes, but damages to Apple are a “mere” $120M But it turned out that the judges who were skeptics of Apple\'s smartphone patents were a decided minority on the court. The full Federal Circuit court decided to take up the case \"en banc,\" and when it was reheard, Apple was victorious on an 8-3 vote.\n\nThat got Apple its $120 million verdict back. Samsung asked the US Supreme Court to be the final arbiter on the matter—just as it was for the first litigation. Today, the high court denied (PDF) Samsung\'s petition without comment. That means the Korean company is seemingly at the end of its long legal road and will need to pay out the $120 million.\n\nThe infringed patents in this case include US Patent Nos. 8,046,721 (slide-to-unlock), 8,074,172 (word correction), and 5,946,647 (quick links). The \'647 \"quick links\" patent, which describes a process for turning structures such as addresses and phone numbers into easily clickable links, accounted for nearly $100 million of the damages award.\n\nFurther Reading Apple got its verdict back—$120M against Samsung It\'s a win for Apple, but it\'s far from what the Cupertino company was hoping for. Apple lawyers had sought more than $2 billion in damages at the second trial, making the jury\'s award around 5 percent of what was asked for. The $120 million won\'t make much of a dent in Samsung\'s bottom line. The South Korean conglomerate\'s third-quarter operating profits amounted to $12.91 billion.\n\nAs for that first verdict, it has gone up and down through appeals courts many times, significantly lowering the damages figure in the process. Right now, it\'s getting lined up for another jury trial to reconsider $399 million in damages. The US Supreme Court said that the method used to calculate damages on design patents, the biggest part of the verdict, was improper.\n\nThe first trial accused a wide range of Samsung phones of infringing iPhone patents, including the Galaxy S and Galaxy S II.

Among other issues, he had argued that his original attorneys had \"badgered\" him into the January 2015 plea agreement.\n\nThe effect, if any, on two other people Maggio has implicated in the bribery scheme -- nursing-home owner and campaign financier Michael Morton of Fort Smith and lobbyist and former state Sen. Gilbert Baker, R-Conway -- is unclear.\n\nA legal expert not involved in Maggio\'s case suggested that the ousted judge\'s likelihood of success at this stage is minimal.\n\n\"I think [the Supreme Court\'s] turning down his petition, that\'s really the end of the line,\" said John DiPippa, interim dean of the W.H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.\n\nThe high court did not comment on its decision.\n\nMaggio\'s attorney, John Wesley Hall, said a case that Hall views as similar to Maggio\'s in terms of a key legal issue could still offer hope to Maggio if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the other case.\n\nThe U.S. solicitor general, who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court, is to file a response in the other case by Nov. 24. That case also deals with a quid pro quo issue, Hall said.\n\nDepending on what the solicitor general says in that case, \"a petition for rehearing might be appropriate,\" Hall said in an email interview. \"On the other hand, it could be a death knell for [that case] that [the Maggio] review was denied\" in the Maggio petition.\n\nHall also raised an old issue as a possible avenue of appeal, one that another Maggio attorney had raised at one point but later abandoned: ineffective assistance of counsel -- specifically by Maggio\'s original attorneys, Lauren Hoover and Marjorie Rogers.\n\nMaggio has alleged that Hoover and Rogers \"badgered\" him into pleading guilty.\n\nNeither Hoover nor Rogers returned email or phone messages seeking comment Monday.\n\nHall said a petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective counsel would be due in 10 months. A petition for rehearing would extend that time, he said.\n\nAsked whether Maggio might cooperate again with the federal government in the hopes of getting his prison time reduced, Hall said, \"Unknown since his cooperation wasn\'t all that good to begin with it would seem.\" Hall said, he was sure the U.S. attorney\'s office would want any information Maggio might have.\n\nHall said such a decision is up to Maggio, \"and we haven\'t talked about it in a while,\" since Hall has been busy with another case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Chris Givens declined comment on whether the investigation of the bribery Maggio detailed in his agreement was continuing. Givens confirmed that anyone in prison can cooperate with the federal government and have the U.S. attorney\'s office recommend a lighter sentence. Givens declined comment on whether that would happen in Maggio\'s situation.\n\nAt this point, Maggio is the only one who has been charged with a crime in the bribery case. In his agreement, he said his campaign had indirectly taken thousands of dollars in funds for his final judicial race in exchange for his lowering a Faulkner County jury\'s $5.2 million judgment to $1 million in a nursing home negligence lawsuit.\n\nThe agreement did not identify Baker or Morton by name, but both men have said Maggio was talking about them. They have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe negligence lawsuit resulted from the 2008 death of Martha Bull, 76, of Perryville in Morton\'s Greenbrier nursing home. On July 8, 2013, Morton signed off on thousands of dollars in donations to several political action committees. On July 10, 2013, Maggio slashed the judgment. Morton has said he intended for the PAC donations to go to Maggio\'s campaign for an appeals court seat, and some did.\n\nBaker\'s attorney, Bud Cummins, did not return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMatt DeCample, a spokesman for Morton, said Morton and his attorney had no comment.\n\nDiPippa said that if the Supreme Court had thought Maggio\'s case was \"sufficiently alike\" the other case Hall mentioned, \"they would have taken both of those cases or asked for additional time in both of them.\"\n\n\"Usually what that means is that they [the Supreme Court justices] don\'t think that anything that they do would affect the Maggio case,\" DiPippa added.\n\nOn the likelihood of Maggio\'s resuming cooperation with the government, DiPippa said, \"I think the issue is whether or not he really does have information that can be used in some other prosecution or investigation. I don\'t know [if he does] because I don\'t know how many other people might be caught up in that investigation.\n\n\"From the outside, it doesn\'t look like there\'d be much information that would be helpful\" that the prosecution hasn\'t already acted upon, DiPippa said. \"But again, I don\'t have enough information to know for sure.\"\n\nAnother element is that the U.S. attorney\'s office in Little Rock has changed leadership since Maggio pleaded guilty. Chris Thyer was the U.S. attorney then but recused from the case, leaving his chief deputy, Pat Harris, in charge. Cody Hiland, a former prosecutor in the same judicial circuit where Maggio formerly presided, became the U.S. attorney in October.\n\nMaggio was a judge in the 20th Judicial Circuit, which covers Faulkner, Van Buren and Searcy counties.\n\nThe statute of limitations for prosecuting anyone else in the bribery case also is approaching.\n\nHarris has said that the window would close in 2018. He was not more specific, and Givens later declined comment on that matter.\n\nThe law provides a five-year limit from the time the last crime occurred. Exceptions include a crime that also involves murder. The Maggio case did not involve a homicide. Based solely on Maggio\'s publicly released plea agreement, the five-year limit could be reached in July 2018.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court ordered Maggio removed from the bench in September 2014 because of comments he made online. Among them were posts about women, divorce, sex, bestiality and a legally confidential adoption case involving actress Charlize Theron.\n\nState Desk on 11/07/2017', 'Justices reject Maggio appeal'),

In 2016 a Supreme Court decision made the 2012 ruling apply retroactively, yet the state of Louisiana continues to push back and fight against giving juvenile offenders an opportunity at parole.\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that according to the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, prosecutors in the state are trying to block too many juvenile murderers from having a chance at parole—which means the state may not be in compliance with the high court ruling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana district attorneys have tried to block, or have already successfully blocked, about one-third of the juvenile murderers who meet the state’s requirement of having served 25 years and completed educational programming to qualify for parole.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, only juveniles who are considered “the worst of the worst” and incapable of being rehabilitated should be sentenced to life without parole—and those should be rare cases. Based on that, Jill Pasquarella—who is an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights—told Nola.com that it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in the state would meet the Supreme Court’s definition of “worst of the worst.”\n\nBecause prosecutors have challenged the parole eligibility of so many juvenile lifers, Pasquarella said that the state will be headed back to court—which will cost the already cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands of more dollars. In addition to the cost of funding a second defense of the state law, in some cases, the state will have to pay the lawyers that represent the juvenile lifers in these cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete Adams is the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, and he acknowledges that the state is probably headed back to court, but he says the Supreme Court needs to add more clarity to what “worst of the worst” means with regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n“Eventually the U.S. Supreme Court will say what’s acceptable and what’s not,” Adams told Nola.com. “If the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can’t get it, we will abide by that.”\n\nInterestingly enough, when the Supreme Court did make its ruling in 2012, Louisiana answered that by creating a law that only gave access to parole to juvenile lifers who had been sentenced after 2012—not those who were already in prison at that time. A juvenile lifer challenged the Louisiana law, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the state clarification and said it needed to give juvenile lifers who were already locked up a chance at parole as well.\n\nIn response to that, during the 2017 legislative session, the Louisiana law was rewritten so that beginning this month (November), juvenile lifers who have served 25 years and meet other requirements, such as obtaining a high school diploma equivalent, would have a shot at parole. The new law leaves room for prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer’s access to parole through a special hearing.\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, run by Leon Cannizzarro, has reviewed the cases of 64 juveniles serving life for murder—more than any other district attorney in the state. The office has filed motions to block 32 of those cases from parole eligibility.\n\nThose 32 cases count in the number that makes up the one-third of the total cases in the state in which the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights says state prosecutors are seeking to challenge parole access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Dan Claitor (R-Baton Rouge)—who sponsored this year’s revised juvenile lifer legislation—conceded that the state’s numbers don’t look good when it comes to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n“I would have to agree—if those numbers are correct—it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,” Claitor said. “I just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.”\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.', 'Despite Supreme Court Ruling, District Attorneys in La.

The verdict could have led to larger damages against the company for later versions of the game, which reaped billions of dollars in revenues, if jurors had found that those, too, had been lifted from Antonick’s work.\n\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Marc Benioff\'s mountain lion sighting sfgate\n\nSmoke wafting from Meraki Market\'s chimney sfgate\n\nSonoma Shine: Firefighter loses his home, but not his voice sfgate\n\nDe Young museum\'s Minecraft map of Teotihuacan sfgate\n\nUpper mountain at Squaw Valley blanketed in snow sfgate\n\nZaza Pachulia discusses Denver game SFGate\n\nMassive lizard found in California backyard sfgate\n\nMurders in San Francisco sfgate\n\nSan Francisco Deltas coach and players talk about the team\'s first year sfgate\n\nSea otter uses crosswalk in Moss Landing sfgate\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who presided over the trial, overturned the verdict in January 2014, saying jurors never actually compared Antonick’s work or his source codes with the later games and thus lacked evidence of illegal copying.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld Breyer’s ruling last November, and on Monday the nation’s high court denied a hearing on Antonick’s appeal, without comment. Breyer’s brother, Justice Stephen Breyer, did not take part in the court’s review of the case.\n\n“Madden Football,” which first appeared in 1988, was a departure from other computer games that depicted a handful of players making robotic movements. The new game, first conceived in a parking lot conversation between the former NFL coach and the founder of Electronic Arts, showed all 22 players carrying out NFL plays.\n\nAntonick was given credit and royalties for the first edition. But Electronic Arts brought in new programming teams in 1990 and said they started from scratch, without using Antonick’s source code.\n\nAt the trial in 2013, an expert witness for Antonick testified that the 1990-96 games were strikingly similar to Antonick’s original version — they used the same plays and formations, the same system of player ratings, a similar wide field and eight-point directional system, and even a pair of lists that both misspelled the word “scrimmage.”\n\nHowever, jurors were not shown the two games side by side, and did not hear evidence about the source code that Antonick accused Electronic Arts of copying.\n\nWithout the source code, the jury “could not compare the works to determine substantial similarity,” Judge Andrew Hurwitz said in a 3-0 ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that upheld Breyer’s decision to overturn the verdict.\n\nJohn De Stefano, a lawyer for Antonick, said Monday that the programmer and a supporting group of law professors had hoped the Supreme Court would take up the case and overturn the appeals court’s “archaic rule” requiring evidence of a computer code to support a claim of illegal copying.\n\n“A lay jury can’t necessarily decipher a computer code, let alone compare them from different platforms,” and should be allowed to rely on expert testimony, De Stefano said. He said Antonick had turned his source code over to Electronic Arts after working on the original version of the game, and it was no longer available when he saw details of the new versions many years later.\n\nElectronic Arts declined to comment.\n\nThe case is Antonick vs. Electronic Arts, 17-168.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Earlier today, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Samsung’s appeal of a jury ruling which originally awarded Apple $120 million after finding that Samsung had infringed upon a number of iPhone innovations, including the slide-to-unlock feature Apple touted on the original iPhone and smart data detection. The data detection feature specifically involves scenarios where iOS is able to detect when an item like a phone number is present in, say, an email. In turn, the number will become a clickable link that will allow the user, in this particular example, to quickly tap it and call the phone app into action.\n\nSamsung, predictably, isn’t happy with the Court’s decision and made a point of noting that Apple’s slide-to-unlock patent has been invalidated by various courts around the globe. Samsung’s statement (via CNET) in the wake of the Supreme Court decision reads in part:\n\nOur argument was supported by many who believed that the Court should hear the case to reinstate fair standards that promote innovation and prevent abuse of the patent system.

The state, town, and community group filed for a petition for certiorari in August, asking for Supreme Court review after the tribe won permission to open a bingo hall, using electronic machines similar to slots, at its vacant community center.\n\n“Once the petitions are denied, we hope the commonwealth and the town will take the tribe up on its longstanding offers to coordinate efforts between our governments so that the entire community will benefit from the tribe’s economic development activities,” Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, the tribe’s chairwoman, wrote in a prepared statement.\n\nAt issue is whether a 1987 land settlement reached between the town, the state, and the tribe remains binding after Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988. The tribe contends that IGRA supersedes the settlement act, which the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld.\n\nIn the agreement, the tribe agreed to “be subject to the civil and criminal laws, ordinances, and jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the town of Gay Head, Massachusetts (including those laws and regulations which prohibit or regulate the conduct of bingo or any other game of chance).”\n\nIn its 40-page court filing, the tribe’s attorneys contend that the language only relates to the short window of time between when the settlement act was codified by Congress and when IGRA was enacted.\n\nThe state and town, which won at the district court level, contend that the settlement act is binding, and that the tribe knew it was waiving its rights to offer gambling on the Island of Martha’s Vineyard. In its brief before the nation’s highest court, the state and town contend that the First Circuit decision is in conflict with another appeals court ruling in the Fifth Circuit that went against a Texas tribe.\n\nIGRA was approved by Congress to resolve questions over tribe rights, the tribe’s brief argues. If Congress wanted to make IGRA not applicable for the Aquinnah Wampanoag, it could have done that, the tribe’s brief argues.\n\n“If any doubt remains, it should be resolved not by looking to legislative history, but on the ground that ‘statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit,’” the tribe’s brief states.\n\nThe state and town case for review also argues that the appeals court decision is in opposition to the Supreme Court with regard to “implied repeals.” In the case where two laws approved by Congress clash, the courts usually side with the more specific of the two, in this case the settlement act, according to the briefs filed in support of Supreme Court review.\n\nThe tribe’s brief contradicts that. “The rule that a later-enacted statute prevails over an earlier conflicting one dictates that IGRA displaces the Settlement Act with regard to gaming. The later-enactment rule is sometimes called the ‘implied repeal’ doctrine: When two federal statutes ‘are in irreconcilable conflict,’ this Court has said, ‘the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one,’” the tribe’s brief states.\n\nIn its petition, the town and community association pointed to an April 1986 hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, where Gladys Widdis, the tribal council chairwoman at the time, testified about the importance of the tribe’s settlement agreement for the development of the tribe economically and socially.\n\n“Mr. Chairman, we recognize and accept that this bill will not empower our tribe to conduct high-stakes gaming on the public or private settlement lands provided in this bill,” Ms. Widdis is quoted as saying. She also provided a written statement, according to the petition. “We recognize and accept that no gaming on our lands is now or will in the future be possible,” she wrote.\n\nThe tribe responds to that by saying Ms. Widdis was referring to an earlier draft of the settlement act, which provided more jurisdiction to the state and town. “Moreover, IGRA had not passed at this point, so the leader’s statements say nothing about her understanding of the gaming landscape after that statute became law,” according to the tribe’s court filing.\n\nAs for arguments that the tribe’s proposed casino will hurt the town or the state’s fledgling casino industry, the tribe’s brief says that’s not true. “Contrary to petitioners’ assertions, the Tribe’s proposed bingo facility would have few, if any, negative consequences for the Commonwealth or the Town, while having many positive impacts for the Tribe,” the brief states.\n\nThe tribe has indicated previously it can make $4.5 million from the Island facility it has planned, a small fraction of the hundreds of millions that would be generated from the Wynn casino under construction in Everett or the MGM casino in Springfield.\n\n“As for its stake in this case, the Town fails to specify how the Tribe’s modest bingo facility will ‘adversely affect’ the local community, or how it will ‘burden’ local government,” the brief states. “A bingo facility on the Tribe’s settlement lands would be tucked away in the remote western corner of the Island, far from the populous towns on the island’s east side. The facility, under the Tribe’s 2015 proposal, would match the architecture that already exists on the island.”\n\nIt remains a long shot that the Supreme Court will take up the Aquinnah Wampanoag case. Each year the court chooses to hear just 1 percent of the cases it’s asked to review.\n\nEditor’s note: Updated to include details from the court filing.', 'Aquinnah tribe officially opposes Supreme Court review - The Martha\'s Vineyard Times'),

More than 20 former judges, prosecutors and legal experts want the U.S. Supreme Court to agree.\n\nArizona attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether state statutes give too much discretion to prosecutors to determine which murders deserve to be punished by a death penalty, and whether the inability of certain counties to fund capital trials violates the due process clause of the Constitution. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\n\nWe’ve been tinkering with the death penalty for 40 years, but haven’t been able to remove mistakes and unfairness from the system.\n\nAs president of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, I joined with more than 20 former Arizona judges, former prosecutors and legal experts to urge the U.S. Supreme Court to accept a challenge to Arizona’s death penalty statute and end capital punishment in our state and nationwide.\n\nFormer Judge Rudy Gerber, who co-authored Arizona’s death penalty statute, has joined in our challenge to the statute, agreeing that it is now unconstitutional. Why?\n\nMost cases can\'t be \'worst of the worst\'\n\nThe court has held that the death penalty is only constitutional if it is reserved for the “worst of the worst.” To comply with this narrowing requirement, prosecutors must prove there is at least one aggravating factor before the death penalty can be imposed.\n\nGerber, to help comply with this requirement, co-drafted the statute with six aggravating factors, any one of which qualifies a defendant for the death penalty. Over time, the Arizona Legislature has piled on more. Today, prosecutors have 14 aggravating circumstances to allege.\n\nThere are now so many aggravating factors that Arizona prosecutors can seek the death penalty in 99 percent of first-degree murder cases. Ninety-nine percent of cases cannot all be “the worst.”\n\nThe Legislature has failed its constitutional duty to narrow the death penalty to the most deserving offenders. The prosecuting agency has the right to decide in which cases it will pursue the death penalty, and the exercise of that discretion varies throughout the state, from zero in some counties to among the highest in the country in others.\n\nMaricopa County leads the nation in death penalty sentences, with a far greater number of cases prosecuted as capital crimes. The Sixth Amendment guarantees that these defendants have the right to counsel and these attorneys must be specially trained and qualified.\n\n31 states have nixed the death penalty\n\nOne consequence is that the county, on multiple occasions, has run out of defense attorneys who are qualified to handle capital cases. As a result, capital cases often wait — sometimes for years — for justice for all parties involved.\n\nThere currently are a staggering 56 death penalty cases pending in Maricopa County’s Superior Court. Capital murder cases cost eight to 40 times more than first-degree murder cases where the death penalty isn’t being sought.\n\nIncreased costs include not only attorneys but court administration, housing, jury compensation and delays to other cases. And because some counties have the money to prosecute death penalty cases and some don’t, where the crime occurred can become more important than the facts of the case.\n\nAs a nation, we have moved away from capital punishment. Thirty-one states have stopped using the death penalty. Nineteen have formally abandoned it, four have instituted moratoria, and eight have not had an execution in the past decade.\n\nOther states keep the public safe through sentences of life without parole. Arizona, which has already abolished parole for adults, can do the same.\n\nThe court should accept review of Hidalgo vs. Arizona and hold capital punishment unconstitutional in our state and everywhere else.\n\nRegardless, the State of Arizona should take a hard look at why we are spending so much money to continue to engage in this failed experiment. It is time to admit that the system is broken beyond repair.\n\nAmy Kalman is a defense attorney in Maricopa County with experience in capital litigation, and is the president of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice.

Litigation involving the company’s female sterilization device Essure has been widespread in the last year.\n\nIn April of 2016, a group of 92 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in St. Louis against Bayer, alleging they suffered injuries after having the permanent birth control implanted.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued Bayer is subject to jurisdiction in Missouri because it does business, generates revenue and conducts marketing for Essure in the state.\n\nBayer moved to dismiss the lawsuit for two reasons. It says it’s not subject to jurisdiction in Missouri, noting only seven of the plaintiffs are from Missouri, while 85 of them have no connection to the state.\n\nIt also contends all the claims are preempted by federal law, meaning the company is immune from the lawsuits because a federal agency approved the devise. Bayer also moved to sever claims by individual non-Missouri plaintiffs and transfer those cases to appropriate venues.\n\nIn December of last year, the circuit court rejected Bayer’s motions. The company will argue for the high bench to overturn the lower court’s decision.\n\nMore than 3,700 women have filed lawsuits against Bayer in the U.S., alleging harm from the device. In its annual statement, the company noted it incurred impairment losses of $413 million in connection with Essure.\n\nIn September, Bayer announced it would end non-US sales of the device, but said its decision was not linked to any problem of safety or quality of the product. Company spokesperson Jennifer Brendel told Modern Healthcare in January that the company has sold 750,000 Essure units around the world, the majority of them in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Essure for the marketplace in 2002, but according to the site Drugwatch, has received more than 5,000 adverse event reports about the device since then.\n\nThe device consists of two metal coils implanted in the fallopian tubes that induce scarring to block the tubes and prevent fertilization.\n\nBayer’s claim that the lawsuit is not subject to jurisdiction in Missouri because most of the plaintiffs are from out of state is consistent with legislation Republicans introduced in the state legislature this year.\n\nBills in the House and Senate were, among other things, intended to reduce the number of cases filed in Missouri courts by plaintiffs with no connection to the state.\n\nThe measures were part of an overall focus by the GOP super majority to improve the state’s business climate by doing away with what it called “frivolous lawsuits”. They failed to advance through the General Assembly while other measures designed to limit liability lawsuits did become law.\n\nFor its part, Bayer claims three court decisions this year – two in the U.S. Supreme Court and one in the Missouri Supreme Court – back its contention that there’s no in state jurisdiction for the claims of the 85 non-Missouri plaintiffs.\n\nThe state high bench, in a case known as Norfolk Southern Railway Company versus Dolan, held Norfolk’s significant business in the state was insufficient to establish general personal jurisdiction over Norfolk.\n\nThe decision was seen as an instance in which Missouri Supreme Court continued the U.S. Supreme Court’s trend toward limiting jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant.', 'Missouri high bench will hear case over St. Louis court\'s decision allowing suit against Bayer'),

As it turns out, it was a futile attempt by Samsung and now, has no option to pay to Apple.\n\nThis is just one of many lawsuits that Samsung and Apple are fighting in lower courts across the US -- the prominent one being the iPhone design patent infringement. The former is accused of stealing iPhone\'s rounded edges, flat screen and shape of apps on the mobile touch screen. The lower court had found Samsung guilty and asked to $339 million fine.\n\nIn December 2016, the US Supreme Court had stayed the order as Samsung found the $339 million fine unfairly high. Samsung wants the court to formulate a fair compensation based on profits from the units sold (as per US\' Design Patent Act of 1887).

The US Supreme Court refused to hear Samsung’s appeal of a ruling that awarded Apple $120 million for a case that started back in 2014.\n\nBack in 2014, a San Jose, California federal court ruled that Samsung infringed several Apple patents that allowed for a lot of popular iPhone features, such as slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, and the ability for information like addresses and phone numbers to automatically turn into links. As a result of that ruling, Samsung was asked to pay US $119.6 million to Apple. That verdict was then overturned by the Federal Circuit but, it was then reinstated in October 2016 by that same court.\n\nAfter that ruling, Samsung appealed the decision to the US Supreme Court. In the appeal, Samsung stated that the Federal Circuit, which specifically deals with patents, made the decision without listening or reading the whole story. The company also implied that the patent court is biased toward patent holders. In a statement, Samsung express its disappointment on the ruling:\n\nOur argument was supported by many who believed that the Court should hear the case to reinstate fair standards that promote innovation and prevent abuse of the patent system. One of Apple’s patents at issue in this case has been invalidated by courts around the world, and yet today’s decision allows Apple to unjustly profit from this patent, stunts innovation and places competition in the courtroom rather than the marketplace.\n\nThe good news for Samsung is that this does not change an earlier decision to dismiss a $399 million verdict against the company. In December 2016, the US Supreme Court sided with Samsung in a case against Apple over patent infringement. The case began in 2012 when Apple sued Samsung, claiming Samsung had violated its design and other patents for its iPhone on many of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones. After years of back-and-forth and re-appeals, Samsung took the case to the US Supreme Court in 2016 where it ruled 8-0 that Samsung does not have to pay $399 million to Apple, overturning an earlier appeals court ruling in this case.\n\nSamsung and Apple have been rivals ever since the Android platform rose to prominence and Samsung became one of the biggest smartphone makers in the world. Apart from the legal battles, both the companies are known to mock each other on social media and their respective ad campaigns.

Breyer’s brother, Justice Stephen Breyer, did not take part in the court’s review of the case.\n\n“Madden Football,” which first appeared in 1988, was a departure from other computer games that depicted a handful of players making robotic movements. The new game, first conceived in a parking lot conversation between the former NFL coach and the founder of Electronic Arts, showed all 22 players carrying out NFL plays.\n\nAntonick was given credit and royalties for the first edition. But Electronic Arts brought in new programming teams in 1990 and said they started from scratch, without using Antonick’s source code.\n\nAt the trial in 2013, an expert witness for Antonick testified that the 1990-96 games were strikingly similar to Antonick’s original version — they used the same plays and formations, the same system of player ratings, a similar wide field and eight-point directional system, and even a pair of lists that both misspelled the word “scrimmage.”\n\nHowever, jurors were not shown the two games side by side, and did not hear evidence about the source code that Antonick accused Electronic Arts of copying.\n\nWithout the source code, the jury “could not compare the works to determine substantial similarity,” Judge Andrew Hurwitz said in a 3-0 ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that upheld Breyer’s decision to overturn the verdict.\n\nJohn De Stefano, a lawyer for Antonick, said Monday that the programmer and a supporting group of law professors had hoped the Supreme Court would take up the case and overturn the appeals court’s “archaic rule” requiring evidence of a computer code to support a claim of illegal copying.\n\n“A lay jury can’t necessarily decipher a computer code, let alone compare them from different platforms,” and should be allowed to rely on expert testimony, De Stefano said. He said Antonick had turned his source code over to Electronic Arts after working on the original version of the game, and it was no longer available when he saw details of the new versions many years later.\n\nElectronic Arts declined to comment.\n\nThe case is Antonick vs. Electronic Arts, 17-168.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The finding cited several incidences in which white students were given more lenient punishments for similar or lesser allegations.\n\nRather than face a hearing on the discrimination charge, Chestnut Hill College filed a lawsuit. The school’s argument was that as a private religious institution (CHC is Catholic but receives some state funding) it has a First Amendment right to discipline students as it sees fit. Two lower courts ruled against CHC, saying exclusions for parochial high schools didn’t count for universities because they are “public accommodations” and offer an environment for free thinking different from secondary schools.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California ruled that Congress did not intend to prohibit service advisors from collecting overtime.\n\nThe outcome at the Supreme Court is bound to have a great impact on how the country\'s 18,000 auto dealerships conduct business. Perhaps more importantly, the ruling will probably extend well beyond auto dealerships to any number of other industries that employ people in service advisor roles. Employers should watch this case carefully.\n\nThe third potential landmark case before the court this term is Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In September, the court agreed to revisit the constitutionality of \"fair share fees\" being imposed upon certain public employees as a condition of employment.\n\nMany Supreme Court observers predicted that mandatory fair share fees to unions would be abolished with the early 2016 decision in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. That decision challenged fair share fees head-on based on First Amendment grounds. The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia a month before the Friedrichs decision was released resulted in a 4-4 deadlock. Therefore, the lower court decision to allow fair share fees was permitted to stand.\n\nIt is highly likely that Justice Neil Gorsuch is poised to be the fifth vote necessary to strike down a 40-year-old precedent, thereby abolishing mandatory fair share fee payments. The decision in Janus is likely to affect millions of public workers in 22 states, including Ohio, which do not have right to work laws. It has been estimated that as many as 30% of public sector union members will cease paying dues if the requirement is abolished. Consequently, an abolishment of fair share fee payments will ultimately weaken unions\' ability to conduct business.\n\nLabor unions are keenly aware of this dynamic. They will likely seek alternatives to existing and upcoming collective bargaining agreements in the short term in an attempt to contractually preserve fair share fees for as long of a period as possible.\n\nMax Rieker is an attorney practicing in the Labor and Employment Practice Group of Cleveland-based Walter | Haverfield.', 'US Supreme Court is poised to decide major labor and employment cases this term'),

Zinke, the Supreme Court is looking to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute that blocks an American from pursuing a pending lawsuit.\n\nThe federal government turned land in Michigan over to the Gun Lake Tribe, which then opened a casino. David Patchak, who lives near the casino, claimed that the building and operation of the casino caused him injury.\n\nPatchak sued the U.S. government. His case previously arrived at the Supreme Court over whether he had standing to sue. After the justices decided Patchak did have standing, former President Barack Obama signed a law that said any legal action regarding the property at issue in Patchak’s case “shall not be filed or maintained in a federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.”\n\nScott Gant, Patchak’s attorney, argued on Tuesday that the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act signed by Obama was “precisely the kind of legislation the Framers rejected when they designed the Constitution.”\n\nGant said Congress can try to affect the outcomes of cases, but how it does so matters.\n\nAnn O’Connell, representing Trump administration Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke, countered that she did not see any separation of powers problems with any law that targets a single case such as Patchak.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed O’Connell on whether the government recognizes any limitations on Congress’ ability to direct the outcome of a given case. O’Connell said a statute suggesting one side “wins” would be unlawful. O’Connell suggested that the justices could look to resolve Patchak by searching for any difference between the statute’s meaning and an explicit direction on how the case should be decided.\n\nPratik Shah, an attorney for the Gun Lake Tribe, similarly argued that there should be no problem with separation of powers with Congress looking to effectively decide the outcomes of various cases.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan suggested a hypothetical example involving whether Congress could constitutionally create a law that wipes out a slate of employment discrimination lawsuits against a large corporation at the company\'s behest. Shah responded that such an action may be unconstitutional, but not for separations of powers reasons, instead because various rules prevent Congress from singling out an individual litigant.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy responded to Shah’s answer by saying that view could “severely compromise the integrity of the courts.” Gant, Patchak’s attorney, began his rebuttal to the government and Gun Lake Tribe attorneys by highlighting his agreement with Kennedy and raising the possibility that his opponents\' thinking could set a dangerous precedent.\n\n“You will have judges looking over their shoulder wondering if they’re going to be next,” Gant said, suggesting judges would resolve cases while thinking about how Congress might choose to tailor the judges’ rulings.\n\nGiving Congress greater authority to affect the outcomes of various legal cases could raise new questions about how the executive branch will exercise its authority in the Trump era. President Trump said earlier this week that the “saddest thing” was, “Because I’m president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. ... I’m not supposed to be doing the kinds of things I would love to be doing and I’m very frustrated by it.”', 'Supreme Court questions if Congress can affect federal courts\' decisions'),

Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felonies, which yielded a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison, a $10,000 fine and four years on parole. After accepting the plea deal and before sentencing, the state became aware of Cuero\'s previous four imprisonments, two of which were also \"strikes\" under California law and would raise Cuero\'s sentencing minimum to 25 years imprisonment.\n\nThe trial court permitted the state to amend its complaint and Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea under California law, which permits the state to amend the pending complaint when prior felony charges are not included in the guilty plea. The trial court distinguished this amendment from one which adds new charges, finding it did not \"fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.\" Cuero was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nCuero filed a federal habeas petition, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [official website] reversed the trial court\'s decision, finding that specific performance of the original plea deal was \"necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.\" Specifically, the court found \"specific performance\" was of the original plea bargain was the proper remedy in this case where previous court decisions treated withdraw of an agreed-upon plea bargain as a breach of contract.\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court considered whether the trial court\'s decision \"involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,\" as required under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 [text] to uphold the Ninth Circuit\'s reversal.

Specifically, \"the trustee attempted to avoid a payment by the bankrupt company, Valley View Downs\"—a horse race track company—\"to Merit Management, in exchange for Merit Management\'s shares in Bedford Downs,\" a competing race track company.

Despite the Seventh Circuit\'s holding in this case, other Federal courts support Merit\'s view; specifically, \"the Second Circuit is very concerned about the effect that this would have on the leveraged buyout industry and -- and, therefore, the economy more broadly.\"\n\nThe question presented before the Supreme Court is whether Section 546(e) concerns avoidable transfers or party liability and whether this transfer was fraudulent and voidable to FTI, where Merit and the intervening banks were conduits and not direct transferees in the transaction. Merit Manager, the petitioner, \"argues that Section 546(e) protects the payment because it came into Merit’s hands from a financial intermediary,\" but FTI, on the other hand, alleges 546(e) protects the types of financial intermediaries and a transfer six bankruptcy trustees\' interests in avoiding fraudulent transfers that deprive the first owed creditors of money owed.\n\nEvident throughout the argument is the court\'s hesitation to adopt Merit Management\'s interpretation because such a ruling could drastically broaden the scope of transactions unavoidable to bankruptcy creditors.

Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that it was a violation of the Constitution to enforce mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders. In the 2016 case Montgomery v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court went even further, ruling that state courts must resentence juvenile offenders, granting these offenders the possibility of parole and freedom.\n\nSince the Montgomery ruling, states have been struggling as they contemplate how to resentence juvenile offenders.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the young people affected?\n\nYouth Radio’s Sierra Fang-Horvath spoke with Marsha Levick, Deputy Director and Chief Counsel at Philadelphia’s Juvenile Law Center and co-counsel to the Montgomery v. Alabama case.The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nSierra Fang-Horvath, Youth Radio: The Montgomery ruling made it possible for inmates sentenced as juveniles to retroactively challenge life without parole rulings. But does that mean states have to automatically undertake the resentencing? Or do inmates have to actively pursue that option themselves?\n\nMarsha Levick: Even if technically the inmate has to pursue the option, I think it’s fair to assume that in the states that are specifically required under both Miller v. Alabama and Montgomery v. Louisiana to resentence the roughly 2,000 individuals around the country who are serving mandatory life without parole sentences, they’re all going to get resentenced.\n\nSFH: Is anything impeding that process?\n\nML: It is a slow process and unfortunately there are a number of factors that have actually contributed to that. Because it wasn’t until 2016 that the Supreme Court required that the Miller decision be applied retroactively, that meant that some of the largest states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Louisiana that house probably about 60 percent of all of the juvenile lifers in the country were essentially four years behind many of the other states that began implementing Miller.\n\nSFH: Do all inmates up for resentencing have the right to be represented by a lawyer?\n\nML: It’s not so much about whether or not they have a right to counsel. It has been challenging, in a number of states, to make sure that everyone has a lawyer to represent them. But once they are actually scheduled for a resentencing hearing, they do have a right to counsel.\n\nSFH: In Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that a juvenile offender must be “permanently incorrigible,” or completely incapable of change, to be sentenced to life without parole. That’s a pretty severe accusation. How would a prosecutor prove that?\n\nML: Actually determining that someone is permanently incorrigible is an extremely high bar. As I think the U.S. Supreme Court said in Miller and in Montgomery, it’s going to be the very rare and uncommon situation where the prosecutor can actually prove that.\n\nSFH: When you, as an appellate attorney, are arguing that your defendant has changed since committing a crime, what do judges want to see?\n\nML: The challenge that we face… is that different judges will view that question and that answer differently. We know that there are still many judges across the country who really are very focused on the crime itself…. But judges need to be able to see beyond that as they’re really instructed to do so by the U.S. Supreme Court, and look at who this individual is. The question that the Supreme Court is requiring [judges] to answer — this notion of who’s permanently incorrigible… that’s separate and apart from the crime that they committed.\n\nSFH: Do you think some states and counties aren’t taking the Montgomery ruling — which says that only permanently incorrigible individuals can be resentenced to life without parole — seriously enough?\n\nML: Yes very much so, I do…. Just look at the language that the U.S. Supreme Court used in both Miller and Montgomery. The Court said that a decision of life without parole for a juvenile offender, even convicted of homicide, should be “rare and uncommon”… If you have a prosecutor in a particular county in Michigan who is seeking life without parole again in all or 90 percent of the cases in that county, it can’t be that 90 percent of those individuals are the rare and uncommon juvenile. That’s not a logical determination…. I hate to use the phrase “we’ll see them in court,” but… if life without parole ends up being re-imposed in a substantial percentage of cases, then I think that’s open to legal challenges. That would certainly seem to be contrary to this idea of a rare and uncommon sentence.\n\nSFH: When someone commits a very serious crime like murder, even if they are under 18, isn’t life without parole a suitable punishment for that sort of crime?\n\nML: I would say no for a couple of reasons. When the U.S. Supreme Court banned the death penalty in 2005 for juveniles who committed murder, [it] said that kids who were under 18 were less culpable and blameworthy for their crimes. That was based on the psychological attributes that the court identified at that time based on research [about]… the susceptibility to negative peer influences, and this capacity, of course, for change and growth and rehabilitation. But importantly, the Court said the death penalty has to be reserved for the worst of the worst, and juvenile offenders are categorically not that person because of their status as adolescents…. We have to ask ourselves, “Are they the worst of the worst?” And in most of the cases, again but for the rare and uncommon juvenile, they’re simply not. It doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be held accountable. It’s not about excusing. It’s about mitigating responsibility and figuring out a way to punish, to hold these individuals accountable, but in ways that also reflect their developmental status.\n\nSFH: Have you ever met someone who was “permanently incorrigible”?\n\nML: I haven’t, no. I think a lot of researchers would say that it’s difficult to paint a picture of who that individual would be, particularly individuals under the age of 18. I think that there may well be experts who would talk about someone who has a mental health diagnosis of psychopathy who might fit that profile. But few experts would diagnose psychopathy in someone under the age of 18 because it’s an extreme and very challenging diagnosis to make. So no, I haven’t. And I don’t know I ever will.\n\nSFH: What future issues do you foresee for the implementation of Miller and Montgomery?\n\nML: What I often say to colleagues is that in this work, every time you think you’ve solved a problem, another one pops up and that’s what’s going to happen here. Even if all… 2000 adults serving juvenile life without parole sentences, are resentenced within the next three to five years, many of them will be resentenced to very long terms: 50 to life, 60 to life, 70 to life, even 40 to life…. Is that effectively also a life without parole sentence? The average life expectancy for many of these individuals is actually kind of in their mid 50s…. So it’s less about will it actually get implemented as it is, to me, about the next series of legal issues that we’re going to be litigating as we see Miller and Montgomery being implemented.\n\nSFH: How do victims and their families feel about these resentencing mandates handed down by the Supreme Court?\n\nML: Victims don’t all have the same view about the perpetrators and their crimes. And there are many… cases where the victim’s family members have stepped forward and supported release, have supported the opportunity for a second chance. They may have had the opportunity to meet with them… [or] to observe their growth, to hear their remorse and their sorrow that they have experienced for what they did. And there are also victims’ family members who will never forgive, for whom the notion that the person who killed their loved ones should ever get out of prison is really an unacceptable scenario…. At the end of the day, the law has set limits for judges engaged in resentencing, even in the face of the most painful, really sorrowful testimony…. At the end of the sentencing hearing, the judge has to set that aside to some degree to enforce the law that the Supreme Court set down in Miller and Montgomery.', 'A Second Chance For Juvenile Offenders?'),

Carner said 468 homes have been sold during the past 12 months, with 51 sales occurring in October — well ahead of the 35 sales that occurred last October.\n\nThough the east Boulder County area is known for its stunning mountain views and wide open spaces, the sales price is fairly modest, at just less than $300 a square foot, Carner said.\n\nThat\'s well below some of the area\'s hottest housing markets, such as the city of Boulder\'s Mapleton Hill neighborhood, where home sell easily for $500 to $700 a square foot, he said.\n\n\"It\'s a good value,\" Carner said, referring to pending sale of the Gorsuch home. \"It\'s certainly not an eye-popping price.\"\n\nA native of Denver, Gorsuch was nominated by President Donald Trump to replace the late Antonin Scalia. He previously served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver beginning in 2006.\n\nGorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on April 7 and sworn in April 10.\n\nStaff Writer Shay Castle contributed to this report.\n\nJerd Smith: 303-473-1332, smithj@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/jerd_smith', 'Neil Gorsuch\'s $1.6M Niwot home under contract');
