Simpson and Patty Hearst trials highlighted the program at the Welty Gala, the annual fundraiser Mississippi University for Women hosts every year to raise money for scholarships.\n\nThe majority of Toobin\'s nearly hour-long speech focused on the Supreme Court and how its political makeup has changed over the last 50 years. He opened the floor for questions near the end of the night, which is when one student asked him his least favorite of President Donald Trump\'s decisions.\n\nFor Toobin, it was Trump\'s demand to National Football League that athletes who kneel during the national anthem be fired.\n\n\"I want to talk about the national anthem,\" Toobin said. \"...The president is saying that, you know, you better stand up during the national anthem ... or get rid of those SOBs if they don\'t stand up. Well in 1943, the Supreme Court had a case called Barnette v. West Virginia Board of Education. That was a case about a school child, a Jehovah\'s Witness, whose religion required him not to salute the flag.\"\n\nToobin read an excerpt from the court\'s majority decision.\n\n\"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein,\" Toobin read. \"If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.\"\n\n\'A political body\'\n\nWhile it was Toobin\'s favorite decision of any Supreme Court justices have written -- and the only one to receive a round of applause from the crowd -- it was far from the only case Toobin touched on in his speech.\n\nHe mentioned Loving v. Virginia in 1967, which legalized interracial marriage, Roe v. Wade in 1973, Bush v. Gore in 2000 and plenty of others, talking about the influence each case had on American culture and how individual justices steered the court\'s decisions.\n\n\"My view is that the Supreme Court is a deeply political body and one whose decisions reverberate through many people\'s every-day lives,\" Toobin said during an interview with the press before the gala. \"But because there\'s no television in the courtrooms, people tend to forget how important it is and what the justices are like behind the scenes. So I like to talk about the significance of the Supreme Court in contemporary politics.\"\n\nMedia and politics\n\nStill, Toobin didn\'t shy away from politics and journalism during question and answer sessions with reporters, MUW students and gala audience members. His topics ranged from Trump\'s Tweets to what it\'s like covering national stories.\n\n\"We\'re at a moment when news seems very politicized,\" he said. \"Between cable news and the internet, and certainly your Facebook feed and Twitter, you can curate what kind of news you get in a way that\'s very different from when your parents were growing up -- basically everyone in the whole country watched Walter Cronkite.\n\n\"(Now) the news media is very atomized and it\'s become atomized by politics,\" he added. \"And I don\'t think that\'s necessarily a bad thing because people can choose the news they want.\"\n\nHe said he doesn\'t even mind Trump\'s use of Twitter, which he takes as statements of government policy.\n\n\"I like the fact that we have this unmediated access to what a president is thinking,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is that sometimes he\'s Tweeting things that are just not true or outrageous like that NBC should have its license taken away ... because the president doesn\'t like what they\'re broadcasting,\" he added.\n\n\'Be a good storyteller\'\n\nToobin\'s advice to students: learn to write well and quickly. More broadly, know that even as methods of spreading news and telling stories change, the audience for those stories will always be there.\n\n\"I think it\'s important to be a good storyteller and to be able to keep people interested in whatever you\'re telling them,\" he said. \"...It\'s true that the forms of distribution are different, but good storyelling -- whether it\'s using video, audio, words -- will always have an audience.\"\n\nThere\'s nothing like being in the middle of a big story, Toobin said.\n\n\"My favorite part is sort of feeling like you\'re at the center of the universe, feeling like everybody wants to know what you know,\" he said. \"...You just feel like people just can\'t wait to hear what you have to say or read what you have to write.\"', 'Welty Gala: Toobin touches on Supreme Court, Trump tweets and journalism', 0, 11.3),

These transcripts are lightly edited and may contain errors. For the definitive record, consult the podcast.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.\n\n\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Hi, and welcome to Amicus, Slate’s podcast about the Supreme Court and the courts in the law. I’m Dahlia Lithwick, and I cover the courts for Slate. This was another busy week at the U.S. Supreme Court, where, despite the fact that the travel ban lawsuit was not argued and then dismissed as moot, which is clearly a win for Donald Trump, the justices heard arguments over whether corporations are liable under the Alien Tort Statute and the scope of the Clean Water Act. But for soap opera fans, there was a fair amount of giggly coverage about the degree to which the court’s youngest justice, Neil Gorsuch, maybe needs to spend a little time in the naughty chair for what seems to be a pattern of cutting off his colleagues and saying things smugly at them.\n\nWe wanted to pan back a little bit this week and talk about the federal judiciary, in part because I think this might be the single-most-unremarked win of the Trump era, and it’s a win that will have consequences that last for decades. Donald Trump took office with a whole mess of vacancies, and we wanted to talk to somebody who could explain to us how Trump is, under the radar, transforming the federal bench. This seems like eye-glazing inside-baseball stuff, but it really isn’t.\n\nI’m so delighted that my guest this week is Kristen Clarke. She’s president and executive director of the national Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. You can call it the Lawyers’ Committee. She’s also one of the sharpest court watchers in the country. Welcome, Kristen, to Amicus.\n\nKristen Clarke: Oh, thank you so much for having me.\n\nLithwick: Did anything I just said strike you as wrong? I mean, is it true? Am I right that, under the day-to-day radar of explosive stories, there is this absolute relentless drumbeat of federal judicial appointments that are quite dramatic, even though they’re not dramatic?\n\nClarke: This is a huge issue that many people are not paying attention to, but almost a crisis-level issue if you think about the number of vacancies that exist across our federal court system right now. There are about 150 federal court vacancies. This matters so much when you think about the kinds of cases and controversies that are handled in our nation’s federal courts.\n\nThe Muslim ban case is a prime example. This is one of the most horrendous and discriminatory actions that we have seen by this administration. The use of an executive order to prohibit people from entering the country from predominantly Muslim nations has set off a firestorm of controversy. Our organization, the Lawyers’ Committee, and a number of other groups, have brought challenges in the courts challenging the Muslim ban. There are a range of other actions that this administration actioned that have wound up in the courts.\n\nThis president, President Trump, will get to name dozens of nominees to many vacant courts around the country. It’s an issue that we have to pay attention to because, at the end of the day, Americans deserve judges who will handle and treat the cases that come before them fairly and with independence.\n\nWhat we’ve seen so far from this president suggests that he’s very focused on naming young, radical ideologues to the courts, people who are far outside the mainstream, people who I fear may not be able to fairly interpret and apply the law, and many people who will bring with them a partisan agenda that they seek to execute while on the bench. This is an issue that impacts all Americans, and one that we have to pay close attention to.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, before we get started too deep in the federal judiciary, talk a little bit about Neil Gorsuch. I mentioned in the intro there’s been a lot of muttering about him this week. You testified at his confirmation hearing. Can you talk a little bit about what you witnessed in the last couple of months?\n\nClarke: Well, one, the opportunity to testify at his confirmation hearing truly, for me, reinforced just how important these confirmation hearings are. I was disturbed at the pace of those hearings. Some of the senators were deeply engaged in rigorously reviewing and examining his record, understand the kind of justice he would be on the Supreme Court. Others were very tuned out. I think that the confirmation process is an important one, and I hope that as we move forward with nominations to the district and circuit courts, we’ll have a Senate that is deeply engaged in doing its job on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOne of the concerns that I raised during the confirmation hearing were real questions about whether Judge Gorsuch had and would have the ability to fairly interpret and apply federal civil rights laws, given some of the cases that he handled on criminal justice and other issues while on the circuit court. So far, I think that those concerns have indeed proved to be valid. This is our first full term with Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. He started in the midst of the last term, but already we’re seeing a lot of indications that he is somebody who is like Justice Scalia. He’s somebody who aligns closely with Justice Scalia.\n\nThis, I think, raises real questions about the incredibly important civil rights cases on the court’s docket this term, cases concerning LGBT equality, partisan gerrymandering, vote purges, and other issues, and truly underscores how important it is when we think about our federal district and circuit courts that we have judges who don’t bring with them an agenda, but instead are judges who can truly be independent in applying the law.\n\nLithwick: It’s worth saying that all the attention that we put on the U.S. Supreme Court, and it’s terrifically important, and Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch, most of us know about that, but let’s be honest and recognize that the courts of appeals are actually the last stop for about 95 percent of the federal cases. The court takes, what, 100, less, cases a year. Actually, the determinant of what the law is in this country, for the most part, is not the Supreme Court; it’s the federal appellate bench, correct?\n\nClarke: That’s true. The Supreme Court does overshadow the federal district courts and the federal appeals courts, but many, the vast majority of cases and controversies, end up being resolved by judges who sit on those courts. It’s why we’ve got to care about the 150 or so vacancies that are out there and that President Trump is actively working to fill right now.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, before we move forward with the actual numbers, because they’re pretty startling, I do want to push back and say what we’re going to hear in response to what you’re saying is, “Look, this is a game both sides can play,” and that when Obama came into office, he put radical ideologues from the left on the court, that, “Well, you’re saying that the Republicans killed the filibuster, but actually the Democrats killed the filibuster.” Bork, Bork, Bork, Bork all the way down. Can you help me understand, if I want to think about this in a neutral and fair fashion, why what Trump is doing right now is any different from what Republicans would say Obama did last go-round?\n\nClarke: Yeah. I guess I would disagree with that characterization. I think that President Obama was very mindful of finding judges who could be fair and independent and, at the end of the day, could draw some margin of bipartisan support.\n\nOne of the long-standing traditions that has been used in the judicial nomination process is the use of blue slips. These are literally blue pieces of paper that, by tradition, not by Senate role, must be returned to the Senate judiciary committee by the home state senators for a nominee, the idea being that senators would best know the judges who were being nominated, or the individuals who are being nominated, to the bench from their respective states.\n\nDuring President Obama’s term, you had folks like Senator Mitch McConnell who urged, who pleaded with President Obama to not abandon the blue slip tradition, and they didn’t. At that time, Senator Patrick Leahy led the judiciary committee, and the blue slip tradition process was adhered to and followed consistently and helped ensure that fair and independent judges would get through the process.\n\nAbout 18 of President Obama’s judicial nominees were not able to proceed, but many others were. I think that the blue slip tradition helps ensure that judges are properly vetted and that judges who fall within the mainstream are the ones who ultimately make it onto the bench and make it to this lifetime-appointed position.\n\nLithwick: Underneath what you’re describing is, again, this is a century-old, seemingly arcane Senate tradition, this gentlemen’s club effort to do something other than shear power when looking at the federal judiciary, but underneath that, there is ... This week, Mitch McConnell told the Weekly Standard on Tuesday that, “We’re done.” He’s doing away with blue slips. They’re just nothing. It’s a symbolic gesture. From now on, they’re immaterial.\n\nHis spokesman seems to have walked that back a little bit on Wednesday. I think that somewhere in the Senate Republican land, there is a conversation about whether to, in fact, do away with blue slips.\n\nThis is not a rule; this is a norm. This is just a courtesy. I imagine that in much the same way that we did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees a few months ago, we can just do away with the blue slip, and there’s not much that Democrats can do to push back, right?\n\nClarke: What’s unfortunate, we shouldn’t be so quick to abandon long-standing rules and traditions that have governed how our Congress operates. When we’re talking about judges who enjoy lifetime appointments, lifetime tenure, we should have close and careful bidding.\n\nOne of the things that I think we sometimes do is we don’t explain fully how the blue slip tradition process works. When we hear talk of Senator McConnell kind of quick to walk away from the courtesy, there may be some people who think, “Oh, yeah. It’s just a courtesy.” But, again, this is a long-standing practice that empowers every senator, irrespective of their party, to help determine which judges get confirmed for local judgeships in their states. It’s a final check to ensure that the courts reflect the actual communities that they serve. It’s one way to filter out people who may just fall too far outside the mainstream.\n\nI think we want a process where senators are working to find consensus around judicial nominees. We want judicial nominees who can enjoy some degree or some level of bipartisan support. To me, it’s more than a courtesy. It truly is an important tradition and one that senators should not be quick to turn their back on.\n\nLithwick: I think I would add to what you’re saying, Kristen, that there are states that have tried to pick their way through what tends to be this intractable fight about judges by creating bipartisan commissions that actually work fairly well to do what you’re saying, which is we get a bunch of people across the aisle, we have them hash out who they could both compromise on.\n\nI think one of the blue slips that’s at issue right now, Senator Merkley has said, “We have a commission here,” and Trump is just ignoring a commission that has picked Republicans and Democrats and seems to be taking the temperature down. That’s a piece of it, too. It’s not just home state senators, but, in some sense, home state senators trying to respect systems that their states have set up to de-escalate what looks like mutually assured destruction, right?\n\nClarke: That’s right. When we take a step back and think about what’s happening further, the other devastating development this past year was the White House ending the use of the American Bar Association’s role in vetting judges.\n\nFor many years, the ABA has played a critical role in producing reports that help ensure that judicial nominees, or explain whether judicial nominees, meet some real basic criteria. Even when they reviewed the record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, they gave Judge Gorsuch the Bar Association’s highest rating, but, nonetheless, the White House has decided to cut them out of the vetting process, and instead what we see is that they’re now working and consulting closely with groups like the Federalist Society to identify nominees.\n\nThe ABA is one of our country’s oldest and largest membership groups. It represents lawyers of all political stripes on the left and on the right, and the reports that they have been produced have been incredibly valuable in vetting nominees and helping the public understand whether or not nominees meet basic threshold criteria.\n\nIn so many respects, we’re seeing traditions thrown out the window. I think all of this presented a dangerous scenario in terms of thinking about the transformation of the courts that could happen in the road ahead.\n\nLithwick: Let’s talk about the actual numbers, because I think this is maybe a way to measure the difference between Trump and the people who’ve come before. As you said, he came on with about 150 vacancies. He’s already named 60 people, I think, for federal judgeships, seven have been confirmed. No president before Donald Trump had named even three judges in the first six months. He’s named nine.\n\nThis is going to more than double the number of federal judges picked by anyone in their first year. The pace, the breakneck pace, is in such contrast to President Obama, who, I think it’s fair to say, was quite slow to start up his judicial-nominations machinery. Is this just one of those “make hay while the sun shines” things where everybody agrees that the one thing we can do is fundamentally transform the courts; let’s do it superfast while no one’s looking?\n\nClarke: There appears to be a real strategy under way. What they’re doing right now is working on filling the open vacancies in states where you have two Republican senators, and presumably where you’ll have no issue in terms of securing two blue slips for a potential nominee. They’re also lining up multiple nominees on the same day, which prevents the public from getting a real opportunity to learn and understand who these nominees are and really prevents the senators from doing their job in reviewing the nominees that come before them.\n\nI was struck, for example, by the fact that they scheduled the hearing of Eric Dreiband, the nominee to lead the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, on the same day that they were considering several other judicial nominees. They are indeed racing forward at lightning speed. They’ve got a strategy in place in terms of the states where they are starting. As a result, we’re seeing a lot of nominees who are moving through the pipeline, who bring with them some really frightening records.\n\nAmong them are folks like John Bush, who was nominated for a vacancy in the 6th Circuit. He’s out of Kentucky. He’s somebody who’s, in his writing, he’s compared slavery and abortion and described these two events as two tragedies in our country. He failed to disclose on a questionnaire that’s reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee the fact that he belongs to a social club in Louisville, Kentucky, that had a long history of excluding African Americans, women, and Jews.\n\nThere are also nominees such as Damien Schiff. He’s somebody who drew headlines when he described Supreme Court Justice Kennedy as “a judicial prostitute.” He’s somebody who also has troubling views on LGBT issues. He once criticized the school district for teaching that homosexual families are the moral equivalent of heterosexual families, arguing that that, in his view, remains an open question.\n\nThese are people who I think should be carefully and closely scrutinized so we can understand whether, if placed on the bench, they can have the capacity to fairly interpret and apply the law and fairly interpret and apply federal civil rights laws. But because of the fast pace at which all of this is moving, we’re seeing some real radical nominees advancing through the nominations process.\n\nLithwick: Kristen, you just mentioned Damien Schiff, you mentioned John Bush. I guess I would add to the pile Jeff Mateer. He’s now been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. He’s described transgender children as “part of Satan’s plan.” You’re describing—I’m describing bloggers. These are not people who have what one would consider as judicial background and temperament. These are people who, as far as I can tell, write and speak polemical screeds.\n\nIn that sense, what I want to ask you is what do we make of the fact that then they come up for their hearings and say things like, “Oh, you can’t put any weight into stuff I said or wrote. I was just being mean. Now I’m going to put on a judicial robe and become this transcendent visionary of neutral legal application”?\n\nI mean that seems to have been the pattern we saw with Schiff and with Bush in their hearings. It seems as though they’re trying to say, “Even if you question me closely on my paper trail, it doesn’t matter because something magic will happen when I become a judge, and I’ll suddenly be a different guy.” How do you even answer that kind of claim?\n\nClarke: Well, the words that people utter, the writings that people have published, all of these things matter and inform and shape the record that nominees bring to them when they go before the Senate for review. I think it’s a mistake to turn a blind eye to those things. They lend insight into the kind of judge that they will be when they put on that black robe. It provides some insight into their likely judicial philosophy. They can help the Senate and the public understand whether or not they truly are independent.\n\nAt the end the day, we want judges who won’t bring with them preconceived views about the facts that come before them, preconceived notions about what the law requires. You want judges who really are independent. It’s not something that every American has the capacity to do, but you really have to be able to look at the facts that come before you and make decisions that are based on the facts within the four corners of the documents and the testimony presented to the court.\n\nI worry that a lot of these radical individuals with fringe views don’t have that capacity and are really making their way onto the bench to advance a political agenda, one that we’ve seen espoused in their statements and their writings prior to being nominated.\n\nLithwick: I want to give you a chance to respond to, again, the proposition that, “Well, but Barack Obama put up radical—he put up radical women on the D.C. Circuit. He flipped the 4th Circuit to the extent that Donald Trump lost the travel ban. There’s no difference, that this is just what presidents get to do.” What’s the answer? Is this a difference of kind of degree, of scale, or is it just that both teams play this way?\n\nClarke: Well, the one thing that I think President Obama did was address the fact that there are certain minority groups that have been long unrepresented on our nation’s court. He did a great job, I think, in advancing judicial diversity. He named and ultimately appointed record numbers of African Americans, Latinos, women, and Asian Americans to the bench, to the extent that people equate diversity with the notion of being radical.\n\nI guess I would dismiss that notion. I think that he has helped to balance out the courts and address the collective failure of presidents before him, ensuring that our courts reflect the growing diversity of our nation. At the end of the day, if we want the public to have confidence in the work of our courts and in the rulings issued by our courts, we want to have courts that reflect our nation and reflect the diversity of the communities in which they fit.\n\nI think President Obama was somebody who was truly sensitized to the work that needed to be done to close those gaps. If that’s being radical, I guess he was radical. I’m glad that he was, because what we’re seeing now is essentially the whitening of the courts. President Trump has made clear that diversity is not at all a priority for him. We’ve not seen many women on his slate of nominees, much less people of color. I am deeply concerned about the fact that we’re at a moment where we are absolutely turning the clock back.\n\nLithwick: To which I would add, these are young nominees. These are significantly younger. There are folks who are being tapped who are in their 30s and 40s, so we’re not talking about a 20-year tenure on the federal bench. We can be talking about a 40-year tenure. That also makes a difference over time.\n\nKristen, before I let you go, I want to give you a chance to answer the question that I think about, and we’ve thought a lot about this on the show, which is why is it that the Republicans have been so energized around issues of the court, not just the Supreme Court, but, as you said, the lower courts? Democrats have really had a hard time connecting the dots between a presidential election, a Supreme Court vacancy, elderly judges at the Supreme Court who need to be replaced, and this issue of the federal bench really being transformed before our eyes. Democrats seem to have somehow hit snooze on this.\n\nClarke: I think that right now there’s a lot of noise out there, and the public is deeply focused on the actions that we see every day from this administration. Every day we’re seeing reversal on policies from the Obama era. We’re seeing new executive orders that are turning the clock back on progress. We’re seeing white supremacists marching in the streets who don’t seem to be fully confronted by this administration or the Justice Department.\n\nThose are the issues that I think have really consumed national dialogue and attention, but it’s important to remember that many of the dangerous actions that have been undertaken by this administration are resulting in litigation by civil rights groups like the Lawyers’ Committee and others. These are cases that are being heard often and tried before our federal courts.\n\nWe’re talking about cases concerning the Muslim ban, concerning sanctuary cities and the threats to take away funding from sanctuary cities, battles that are brewing over voting rights. Last week, we saw the elimination of the contraceptive mandate. All of these issues that are front and center for the public actually have litigation that are coming right behind it, which is why we can’t ignore what’s happening with respect to the transformation of our courts.\n\nOne hundred and fifty vacancies, or somewhere thereabout. That’s a lot of individuals who ultimately will enjoy lifetime appointment and who can have impacts that we’ll feel for generations. We’re watching closely to see who these nominees are, we’re watching closely at the fact that we’re turning the clock back when it comes to diversity, and urge the public to be engaged in this process.\n\nAt the end of the day, the senators do have a job. They do have an obligation and a constitutional responsibility to fully and fairly evaluate these judicial nominees, and the public should speak up, speak out, and reach out to their senators when they learn about nominees that fall too far outside the mainstream.\n\nLithwick: Kristen Clarke is president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the country’s most important national civil rights organizations. She watches the judicial branch closely, and we need to, as well. Kristen, it was a pleasure having you on Amicus this week.\n\nClarke: Thank you for having me.', 'How Donald Trump Is Filling the Numerous Vacancies on the Federal Bench', 0, 50.5),

Although the measurements were disputed, the board sided with the homeowners.\n\nThe store owners filed a lawsuit contending that the denial of the permit was a violation of their constitutional rights, particularly their Second Amendment rights and those of their customers.\n\nA federal district court dismissed the case, but a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, agreeing that there was a Second Amendment claim that should be heard.\n\nBut now that ruling has been overturned by an en banc (full court) panel of the Ninth Circuit, which held that the Second Amendment does not confer a “freestanding right on commercial proprietors to sell firearms.”\n\nAn attorney for the store owners , who have the support of the Calguns Foundation, the Second Amendment Foundation and the California Association of Federal Firearms Licensees, said it “seems very likely” that they will petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.\n\nAt issue is not whether the retailers’ Second Amendment rights in this instance were violated, but whether they have Second Amendment rights at all. The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that there are “ancillary rights necessary to the realization of the core right to possess a firearm for self-defense,” but the Supreme Court has been vague about what restrictions are permissible.\n\nThe justices owe the nation more clarity. Cases involving bans on gun shows, rules on concealed carry permits and the rights of retailers deserve to be heard.', 'The Supreme Court needs to provide clarity on the Second Amendment', -0.2, 5.3),

Mahony', '2017-10-23', 'In a case that implicates free speech, fighting words and the coarsening of public discourse, state prosecutors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a 25-day jail term on a Rockville woman convicted of upsetting public order by flinging disgustingly vile insults at a grocery store manager.\n\nThe prosecutors want the court to reverse the state Supreme Court, which ruled in July that Nina Baccala was protected by constitutional free speech guarantees when she blasted a Stop N Shop night manager with a string of vulgarities punctuated with what the state justices called “one or more of the most vulgar terms known in our lexicon to refer to (the female) gender.”\n\nBaccala was convicted of breach of the peace for using “fighting words,” a narrow category of speech that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 80 years ago is not protected by the First Amendment because it is likely to cause the person being addressed to retaliate quickly and violently.\n\nState prosecutors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the appeal.\n\nThe nation’s high court gets thousands of such requests a year and turns most aside. The court could announce later this year whether it will take the case.\n\nThe evidence presented against Baccala, 45, showed that she called the Stop N Shop in Vernon during the evening hours four years ago to announce that she would be arriving to pick up a Western Union money transfer. Assistant store manager Tara Freeman told her the store wasn’t processing transfers because the customer service desk was closed.\n\nBaccala arrived anyway. She was told again that transfer service was unavailable and directed a verbal tirade at Freeman that could be heard by other store employees and customers. Freeman retained her composure and, eventually, said “have a good night,” and Baccala left the store.\n\nShe was later arrested and convicted.\n\nThe state Supreme Court reversed. Writing for the majority, Justice Andrew McDonald said courts must consider the context of confrontations before labeling speech as fighting words. The decision said that managers of large stores are similar to police officers in that they have learned through training or experience not to react violently to vitriolic insults.\n\n“Store managers are routinely confronted by disappointed, frustrated customers who express themselves in angry terms, although not always as crude as those used by (Baccala),” the court said.\n\nThe state court also wrote that the coarsening of everyday language makes it less likely that people will respond violently to language because “public sensitivities have been dulled to some extent by the devolution of discourse.”\n\nAssistant State’s Attorney Mitchell Brody, who has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case, wrote in the state’s papers that the Connecticut justices have improperly shrunk the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of unprotected speech by creating a new classification of citizen who can be berated without consequence.\n\nBrody also argued that “a general coarsening of discourse may provoke rather than diminish violent responses.“\n\n“This Court has never considered the question of whether the prevalence of degrading language generally hardens ordinary citizens to its vulgarity or, instead, sensitizes them, putting them on edge and rendering them prone to violent retaliation when they are personally targeted,” he wrote.\n\nHe said in an interview that prosecutors are pressing an appeal because of the numbers of cases of verbal abuse in the state’s court dockets.\n\n“We have a case right now we’ve filed in the appellate court in which someone used racial language against a parking lot officer and there are many more,” Brody said. “It seems that the boundaries are starting to disappear. The reason we are prosecuting this stuff is because it is bubbling up and the line between civilized and uncivilized behavior has really eroded. It’s not as if we are out there to sort of despoil the First Amendment.”\n\nAttorney John L. Cordiani Jr., representing Baccala, filed papers Monday arguing that the state Supreme Court settled the case properly when it decided that, in certain contexts, there is no likelihood that violent language will provoke a physically violent reaction.\n\n“Absent truly extraordinary words, a police officer is not likely to hit an irate detainee who is expressing his anger purely verbally,” Cordiani wrote in his papers to the nation’s high court. “A school teacher will probably not react violently to a misbehaving student. In a theatrical production or stand-up comedians are unlikely to physical retaliate against boorish hecklers. And most importantly for the purposes of this case, the manager of a large grocery store is not likely to attack a disgruntled customer in retaliation for profane name-calling.”', 'State Asks US Supreme Court To Take Case Involving Abusive Language', -0.4, 14.3),

I got a four-year scholarship because of basketball, and I did well in college, and the rest is history,” said Harper, 74. “Here’s a white man who took an interest in an inner-city kid. He put me on the right path. He believed in me, and he believed in my ability.”\n\nWhen Harper went back to school to get his master’s degree, he again had a professor who took an interest. He said it has been an accumulation of experiences that shaped his belief and commitment to diversity and inclusion, starting from when he was just a young man playing basketball.\n\n“When I hear people trying to divide based on race, that runs counter to my experience. So I’m determined to try to make a difference,” he said. “So when I see what’s happening on a national level, it pains me. It pains me that we’re tearing people apart based on their ethnicity, based on the color of their skin, based on their religion. So I’ve been committed to fight against that, and I’ve dedicated my life to try to pull people together.”\n\nIn a keynote address given Monday that kicked off the Connecticut judicial branch’s Diversity Week, Harper said building a culture of inclusion is an enduring challenge for both the nation and the state judicial branch, pointing to the violence at the Aug. 12 demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, as an example.\n\nHeld by the judicial branch’s Advisory Committee on Cultural Competency, the event was part of an effort to build a better workplace environment for its employees and to better serve the public, said Supreme Court Justice Richard Robinson, who also serves as the committee’s chairman.\n\n“Culture makes a difference, how people are treated makes a difference, and some people felt they weren’t being treated equally when they came to the judicial branch. Now just imagine, the only reason we have power is because people trust us, and if people start to distrust us, then we don’t have power,” said Robinson. “People stop listening to our rulings, our edicts, people stop believing the system is fair for them, and so they willingly give us their power, they willingly give us this trust. This is our way of respecting that, and of showing the public we really do care about them as individuals, regardless of race, creed, color, gender, sexuality, all those things.”\n\nThe week-long event features speakers who will talk about a range of topics from veterans’ issues to race relations and religious issues.\n\n“Our country, our power, our beauty is in our diversity and we need to embrace that and understand that,” Robinson said.\n\nWhile Harper said he is not “naive” enough to believe “hardened bigots” can be reasoned with or have their minds changed, he said he does believe now is the time for people “of good will, who believe in justice and equality for all” to engage in a discussion among people of all races, faiths and ethnicities. He said if America is truly going to be a diverse and inclusive society, people need to appreciate human and cultural differences.\n\nHowever, he doesn’t think it should take “catastrophic” natural disasters or mass murder to make people realize their common humanity. Quoting the words of former President Jimmy Carter, Harper said, “‘We are, of course, a nation of differences. Those differences don’t make us weak. They’re the source of our strength.’”\n\nOne of the challenges Harper said he believes the country faces is its refusal to accept the reality of its changing demographic as the population becomes more diverse and white Americans will eventually become a minority. As the country moves toward a future where “so-called minorities” will be the majority, he said the nation as well as the state’s judicial branch must “double down” its efforts to advance diversity.\n\nWhile Connecticut’s judicial system has made significant strides, the organization needs to continue to build on its progress by recognizing that its greatest asset is its employees, he said. Harper said he wants to create an environment in which all minorities are adequately represented, believing the judicial system should mirror the population it serves.\n\n“For, if it does not, then that growing majority of our diverse work force will lose faith and confidence in the branch’s efforts to build a culture of inclusion. ... I believe it is equally vital that we are perceived as worthy of the faith and confidence reposed in us by the individuals and greater society that we serve,” Harper said.\n\nHe concluded that members of the state’s judicial branch have an opportunity to make a difference, “to be a voice that works toward and demands diversity,” explaining to do otherwise would run counter to its mission to provide “justice for all.”\n\njessica.lerner@hearstmediact.com; @jesslerner on Twitter', 'New Haven\'s Lubbie Harper Jr., retired Supreme Court justice, makes call for diversity in justice', 0, 16.1);

Samsung lawsuit is getting a big \"reset,\" thanks to last year\'s Supreme Court ruling on design patents.\n\nThe long-running litigation rollercoaster has included so many turns it\'s hard to keep track. The case was filed in 2011 and went to a 2012 jury trial, which resulted in a blockbuster verdict of more than $1 billion. Post-trial damage motions whittled that down, and then there was a 2013 damages re-trial in front of a separate jury. An appeals court kicked out trademark-related damages altogether.\n\nFurther Reading Samsung victorious at Supreme Court fight with 8-0 opinion against Apple Meanwhile, a whole separate case moved forward in which Apple sued over a new generation of Samsung products. That lawsuit went to a jury trial in 2014 and resulted in a $120 million verdict, far less than the $2 billion Apple was seeking. That verdict was thrown out on appeal, then reinstated on a subsequent appeal. So that one appears to stand.\n\nBut back to that first case. After a lot of back and forth, Samsung agreed to make a payment of $548 million, but the Korean giant didn\'t give up its right to appeal. In a landmark case over design patents, the US Supreme Court said that the damages had been done all wrong—but the justices gave little guidance as to how they should be done. The high court threw out $399 million of the damages Apple had won.\n\nYesterday, US District Judge Lucy Koh published a 35-page order (PDF) explaining her criteria for the new trial. A scheduling hearing will take place later this week. There are two types of patents: design patents cover the way something looks, while utility patents cover the way something is used and works. All that\'s left at issue in this litigation is design patents, which cover the look of the iPhone\'s outer shell, software icons, and other features.\n\nArguing Articles\n\nEssentially, Samsung complained about the verdict because it involved Apple getting paid for the whole phone, even though the design patents only covered specific aspects of the phone\'s hardware and software.\n\nThe US Supreme Court said that it was wrong to give Apple damages on the entire phone because of a few design patents. The phone, the justices argue, wasn\'t necessarily the right \"article of manufacture\" to consider. But the high court didn\'t say what the right article should be, and it didn\'t rule out the idea of using the entire phone—the Supreme Court just said the entire phone shouldn\'t automatically be used.\n\nThat led the parties to gear up arguments for an incredible fourth jury trial. Apple and Samsung made their arguments over what the test should be, but Judge Koh ended up going with the test suggested by the US solicitor general, which has four factors to determine the right \"article of manufacture.\" It\'s closer to Apple\'s suggestion—Samsung had suggested basically taking only the part of the product that had the patented design physically applied to it, a test that Koh said wouldn\'t even pass the basics of what the Supreme Court had asked for.\n\nThe factors of the four-part test that will apply are laid out at the end of Koh\'s order. They are:\n\nThe scope of the design claimed in the plaintiff\'s patent, including the drawing and written description;\n\nThe relative prominence of the design within the product as a whole;\n\nWhether the design is conceptually distinct from the product as a whole; and\n\nThe physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product, including whether the design pertains to a component that a user or seller can physically separate from the product as a whole, and whether the design is embodied in a component that is manufactured separately from the rest of the product, or if the component can be sold separately.\n\nKoh also ruled that Apple should bear the burden of proof in determining the article of manufacture.\n\nDesign dilemma\n\nAt this point, any possible result of the lawsuit has long been factored in to the bottom line of these two mega-rich corporations. No possible outcome could really change the fortunes of either one.\n\nThe long case reflects indecision over what to do about design patents. Such patents are just one small aspect of a sprawling intellectual property system that weren\'t a hot topic of discussion, even in legal circles, until Apple\'s litigation made them important.\n\nWe live in a society that recognizes how creative design can have huge value, and that\'s not a bad thing. No one has leveraged that cultural bias more intensely than Apple, which has not only translated design into unprecedented profits but has convinced judges, juries, and lawmakers that it should be allowed to wield design as a powerful tool to stop competitors.\n\nApple has diligently worked to create a world where design can be effectively weaponized. But when judges have analyzed the actual results of such heavy enforcement, what they find may be uncomfortable. Huge awards could stifle innovation by dealing wipe-out blows to companies (not Samsung, but others) for reasons that range from tangential to trivial. The \"solution\" in this case has been to create judicial paralysis and to allow never-ending litigation.', 'After Supreme Court detour, Apple v. Samsung goes to a fourth jury trial', -0.1, 14.4),

Gorsuch was welcomed by conservatives of all stripes because of his deep commitment to judicial originalism. However, in a certain notable way, Gorsuch differs from his predecessor, the late Antonin Scalia, who was also a champion of originalism. A recent statement by the new justice highlights both this difference and a potential stinging point for President Trump and his branch of government.\n\nThis past week, the Supreme Court rejected a petition for certiorari in a case involving administrative agency law. The case, Scenic America v. Department of Transportation, involves a dispute between a nonprofit organization and the Federal Highway Administration. Though the Supreme Court ultimately did not accept the case, Justice Gorsuch issued a very revealing statement in response to the petition.\n\nIn his statement, the justice seems to challenge the legal concept of Chevron deference, in a sharp contrast to his predecessor who supported it. Chevron deference describes the deference a court grants to a federal administrative agency when it comes to statutory interpretation. Under such deference, articulated in the 1984 case Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, courts will typically accept an agency’s interpretation of a statute as long as it can be construed as reasonable (a very low burden). There have historically been a couple salient reasons for this. First, agencies are often thought to be experts in their own subject matter. And second, it is thought that agencies should be given deference in their interpretations by virtue of the fact that Congress delegated certain legislative powers to them.\n\nThe issue in Scenic America is slightly more complex, however, because the case doesn’t explicitly involve an agency’s interpretation of a statute. Instead, the case concerns an agency’s interpretation of a contract that it is party to with a state. The circuit court held that the Chevron test for reasonableness should nevertheless be applied in cases involving contractual interpretation—but the matter is disputed by other circuits.\n\nGorsuch, in his response to the petition for cert, seems very skeptical of the appellate court’s line of reasoning. “But contracts usually represent compromises between two or more parties. And is it reasonable to suppose that one side to a compromise always has more expert insight into its meaning?” he writes.\n\nPerhaps Gorsuch has a good point. Expanding Chevron deference to include the interpretation of contracts would seem to give unequal power to one party in a contract, namely the governmental agency. At the same time, it is an undeniable fact that Gorsuch’s argument would weaken the power of the administrative state by stripping it of its ability to authoritatively interpret contracts.\n\nGorsuch’s statement is particularly interesting because it reveals what could be for President Trump an unintended consequence of his decision to appoint the new justice. The president, who ultimately oversees the administrative state, may be surprised to learn that Gorsuch wants to curb his power.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is not the first time in his career that Gorsuch has expressed disdain for Chevron deference. He did so most famously in another case entitled Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, where he authored both the majority opinion and a concurrent opinion specifically intended to take aim at Chevron deference.', 'Gorsuch\'s Views On Administrative Law Could Spell Trouble For the Executive Branch', 0.1, 8.4),

This divide is more fundamental than mere partisan identification, as there are Democrats and Republicans in both groups.\n\nOne of the best formulations of this division comes from photographer Chris Arnade, who has spent years documenting the lives of America’s forgotten classes. In his characterization, America is split between the “Front Row Kids,” who did well in school, moved to managerial or financial or political jobs and see themselves as the natural rulers of their fellow citizens, and the “Back Row Kids,” who placed less emphasis on school and who resent the pretensions and bossiness of the Front Row Kids.\n\nMore: President Trump: With tax reform we can make it morning in America again\n\nMore: Donald Trump is restoring respect for constitutional limits\n\nWhile teaching constitutional law after the election, it occurred to me that while the Back Row Kids can elect whomever they want as president, senators or representatives, there is one branch of the federal government (and all state governments) that is, more or less by its nature, limited to Front Row Kids: the judiciary.\n\nSomeone like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker can hold office without a college degree, but as a practical matter, the judiciary is limited to people who hold both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Since law degrees became a required part of admission to the bar, the judicial branch has been the domain of people who are not merely highly educated, but educated in the particular way that law schools educate. They are, in short, Front Row Kids of the first order.\n\nAfter realizing that, my march through the decisions of the Warren Court and its successors took on a different flavor. Again and again, seen through the lens of this class divide, important decisions look like decisions on behalf of the Front Row Kids. In the famous Goldberg v. Kelly case granting due-process hearings prior to the termination of welfare benefits, the Supreme Court looks to have been holding on behalf of poor and uneducated people. Yet it turns out that the actual beneficiaries are the highly educated: Social workers and lawyers, who are paid out of welfare agency budgets. Likewise, the court’s treatment of everything from reproductive rights to legislative apportionment has reflected Front Row priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, has become more and more elite. Increasingly, judges aren’t just law school graduates, they’re graduates of the most elite law schools. And that goes double for the Supreme Court, where everyone is a graduate of Harvard or Yale except for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who got her degree from that scrappy Ivy League upstart, Columbia. As Dahlia Lithwick observed in 2014:\n\n“The current justices are intellectually qualified in ways we have never seen. Compared with the political operators, philanderers and alcoholics of bygone eras, they are almost completely devoid of bad habits or scandalous secrets. This is, of course, not a bad thing in itself. But the court has become worryingly cloistered ... There is not a single justice “from the heartland,” as Clarence Thomas has complained. There are no war veterans (like John Paul Stevens), former Cabinet officials (like Robert Jackson), or capital defense attorneys. The Supreme Court that decided Brown v. Board of Education had five members who had served in elected office. The Roberts Court has none. What we have instead are nine perfect judicial thoroughbreds who have spent their entire adulthoods on the same lofty, narrow trajectory.”\n\nLithwick wrote this before the accession of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the court, but his background is the exception that proves the rule. Although some see him as bringing heartland values because he came to the court from Colorado, he is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. Only in today’s Supreme Court, composed of “judicial thoroughbreds,” would his resume seem even a little bit populist.\n\nMore: Memo to both parties: Stop foot-dragging on Children\'s Health Insurance\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with thoroughbreds as such, and if the court decided only narrow technical issues of law none of this would matter. But some of the most important social issues of the day come before the court, and given its members’ insularity, the problem is not just that Back Row America’s values won’t be considered — it’s that the court may not even realize it’s ignoring them. It’s worse still when you realize that, as Angelo Codevilla has noted, America’s ruling class is itself much narrower than it used to be:\n\n“Today’s ruling class, from Boston to San Diego, was formed by an educational system that exposed them to the same ideas and gave them remarkably uniform guidance, as well as tastes and habits. These amount to a social canon of judgments about good and evil, complete with secular sacred history, sins (against minorities and the environment) and saints. Using the right words and avoiding the wrong ones when referring to such matters — speaking the ‘in’ language — serves as a badge of identity.\"\n\nTo counteract this, we might want to bring a bit more diversity to the court. I’m not recommending that we eliminate the informal requirement that judges have law degrees (though non-lawyer judges were common in colonial times, and some countries still use them). But maybe we should look outside the Ivy League and the federal appellate courts. A Supreme Court justice who served on a state court — especially one who had to run for election — would probably have a much broader view of America than a thoroughbred who went from the Ivy League, to an appellate clerkship, to a fancy law firm.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY\'s Board of Contributors.

Davis has not received much attention from court-watchers anticipating a slew of blockbuster cases this term, but the justices\' ruling on the dispute could have a lasting impact on many criminal and death penalty cases and the legal protections given to illegal immigrants.\n\nA Texas court sentenced Carlos Manuel Ayestas, a Honduran man, to death in 1997 after his conviction for murdering Santiago Paneque during a burglary of her Houston home.\n\nAyestas appealed his conviction on the grounds that his trial lawyer failed to collect testimony from his family members who could have provided evidence to support his case. The Texas courts rejected Ayestas\' appeals.\n\nThen in 2009, Ayestas again appealed his case, this time with a different lawyer, and said his trial attorney failed to conduct a reasonable investigation that would have yielded \"available and abundant\" evidence of mitigating factors. Ayestas said that evidence would have revealed relevant information about his upbringing and that he suffered from early-stage schizophrenia, addiction, and other mental illnesses.\n\nAyestas\'s father was purportedly 20 years older than his mother when they met, and his dad fathered 22 children with several women. After fathering three children himself by the time he was 17, Ayestas traveled to the U.S. while telling his mother that he was headed to Guatemala. Along the way, Ayestas\' family has said, he was abducted in Mexico and held for ransom.\n\nA federal district court ruled against Ayestas\' later appeal on a procedural matter, saying that Ayestas had not raised the new claims in earlier proceedings in the Texas state court. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.\n\nBut a ruling from the Supreme Court may have helped breathe new life into Ayestas\' case. The Supreme Court issued a 7-2 opinion in Martinez v. Ryan, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2012, which said that an attorney\'s blunders in court proceedings after a conviction do not give the courts a reason to excuse procedural defaults.\n\nAyestas sought a rehearing in light of that decision and filed a motion for investigative assistance that he deemed \"reasonably necessary\" to prove his claims. The federal courts shot down his motion.\n\nNow, the Supreme Court is looking to determine whether the investigative services Ayestas wants are \"reasonably necessary\" only if petitioners have prevailed in earlier proceedings of the sort that Ayestas lost.\n\nAt the time of Kennedy\'s opinion in Martinez v. Ryan, the late Justice Antonin Scalia dissented because he thought Kennedy was creating a constitutional right to effective counsel in collateral court proceedings, such as the later hearings on Ayestas\' appeals.\n\n\"Despite the court\'s protestations to the contrary, the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose considerable economic costs on the states and further impair their ability to provide justice in a timely fashion,\" Scalia wrote in his 2012 dissent. \"The balance it strikes between the finality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such claims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue (since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas joined Scalia\'s 2012 dissent.\n\nWhether Scalia\'s successor, Justice Neil Gorsuch, shares the late justice\'s view or that of his former boss — Kennedy — could prove critical in determining the outcome and scope of the high court\'s decision in Ayestas.

The court is slated to hear more big cases in the first month of its 2017 term than it did all of last year.\n\nThe justices returned to work on Sept. 25 and began hearing oral arguments Oct. 2. It marked the start of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s first full term, months after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nNo longer afraid of a 4-4 split, some of the significant constitutional issues before the court include cell phone privacy, partisan gerrymandering and the rights of same-sex couples. The justices also have agreed to consider key cases that will impact the business community, including those involving intellectual property, employment law and corporate liability.\n\nGov. Chris Christie’s fight to legalize sports gambling in New Jersey also will come to an end one way or another as the court takes up Christie v. NCAA and New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association v. NCAA. While the lower courts have rejected the state’s argument that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act is unconstitutional, New Jersey may have a better shot with the Roberts Court, which has been critical of federal overreach.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of several other highly anticipated cases on the Supreme Court’s docket so far:\n\nGill v. Whitford: The court will revisit the issue of partisan gerrymandering this term. While gerrymanders that dilute the votes of a particular race clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, the court has struggled to establish a test for partisan gerrymandering. The justices first must determine whether such claims are justiciable and, if so, determine the proper standard for assessing whether the redistricting plan passed by Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled legislature in 2011 is permissible.\n\nCarpenter v. United States: This Fourth Amendment case will determine whether law enforcement officers must obtain a warrant to access historical cell-site records, which indicate which cell towers a cellphone connected with while it was in use and can be used to track a suspect’s location. While the court’s third-party doctrine traditionally has held that certain records or information shared with third parties are not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, the court’s precedents all predate the proliferation of cell phones, the Internet and electronic data.\n\nJesner v. Arab Bank: The court is slated to finally address whether corporations can be held liable under the Alien Tort Statute. Enacted in 1789, the federal statute states that U.S. courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil lawsuit “by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” The decision will impact the extent that corporations can be held liable for transactions with suspected terrorist organizations as well as human rights abuses committed overseas.\n\nMarinello v. United States: The court will resolve a circuit split over whether a conviction under the U.S. Tax Code for “corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the tax laws” requires proof that the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending Internal Revenue Service action. The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and three other circuits, have held that a defendant may be guilty of obstructing the administration of the tax code even if the defendant has no knowledge of a pending IRS action or proceeding or even if there is no pending IRS action or proceeding.\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission: The latest same-sex marriage case to come before the court involves a Colorado bakery’s refusal to create a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. While the lower court ruled that refusing to bake the wedding cake amounted to sexual orientation discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, the bakery owner argues that compelling him to create expression that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage violates the free speech or free exercise clauses of the First Amendment.\n\nThe court will continue to add cases to its docket over the course of the term.

American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, Docket No. 16-1466, the governor of Illinois, along with two public sector employees, brought suit challenging a law that allows public sector employers to require nonmember employees to pay a fee to the union. The governor alleged the law violates the First Amendment by forcing public employees to contribute money to an organization that they may not approve of. The district court looked to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, on the issue for precedent and dismissed the suit. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\n\nAbood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), involved a Michigan law authorizing union representation of public sector employees through an agency shop arrangement. The agency shop arrangement required all employees represented by the union, even if the employee is not a union member, to pay a fee as a condition of employment. A group of teachers filed suit alleging they opposed unions in the public sector, that the union was engaged in political activities the teachers did not approve and were not related to the collective bargaining activities, and requested the agency shop clause be declared invalid under state law and the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately held that the service charges used to finance expenditures by the union for collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes, are valid. Union expenditures not germane to its duties as a collective bargaining representative, however, must be financed from employees who do not object to advancing those causes or coerced into doing so against their will by threat of loss of employment.\n\nJust last year, the U.S. Supreme Court examined this very issue in Friedrichs v.

Instead, Jane Doe was forced to go to a Crisis Pregnancy Center, where minors receive counseling directed to dissuade them from having abortions.\n\nThe abortion was delayed for weeks while lawyers with the ACLU and the Trump administration battled over the federal government\'s role in allowing Doe to have the procedure. The ACLU claimed the federal government was forcing Doe to continue her pregnancy against her will and that she has the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the federal government is not required to facilitate an abortion for a minor in its custody and that Doe could seek the procedure by returning to her home country or having her custody transferred to a sponsor that agrees to take her to an abortion clinic.\n\n“Justice prevailed today for Jane Doe.

Millett, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, first dissented from a decision by a three-judge panel delaying an undocumented minor’s abortion. Her dissent was so powerful that when the full D.C. Circuit eventually reversed the panel’s ruling, it did nothing more than explain in a single paragraph that Millett had it right. The judge then took a well-earned victory lap, penning a trenchant concurrence that excoriated her conservative colleague’s anti-abortion, anti-immigrant casuistry. Her brilliant performance secured a vulnerable young woman’s right to bodily autonomy. It should also earn Millett a spot at the very top of the Supreme Court shortlist the next time a Democratic president gets tasked with making a selection.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nEven before Millett’s recent triumph, the 54-year-old judge was widely recognized as a Supreme Court contender. Her resume is sterling: She graduated from Harvard Law, clerked on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and worked at the Department of Justice preparing and arguing appellate cases. She then served as an assistant to the solicitor general, ultimately arguing 25 cases before the Supreme Court. Millett then took a job at the prestigious firm Akin Gump in 2007 and continued to argue before the justices. In June 2013, President Barack Obama nominated her, along with Robert L. Wilkins and Nina Pillard, to the D.C. Circuit. That December, Democrats eliminated the filibuster for lower-court nominees in order to confirm the trio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMillett’s role in the Jane Doe ordeal illustrates why Obama was eager to elevate her to the bench. The saga began in September, when the Trump administration tried to stop Doe, an undocumented 17-year-old, from obtaining an abortion. Doe arrived in the country illegally and was placed in a federally funded shelter, which refused to let her terminate her pregnancy, following a government directive. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Doe sued, alleging a violation of her constitutional right to abortion access. A district court ruled in her favor, but the Justice Department appealed. The case was assigned to a panel of three randomly selected judges: Millett, plus conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Karen L. Henderson.\n\nAt oral arguments, Millett laid bare the flaws in the DOJ attorney’s argument. The government claimed it did not want to “facilitate” Doe’s abortion and that Doe could self-deport if she wanted the procedure. But in reality, Millett noted, the government was merely vetoing Doe’s abortion, asserting direct control over her reproductive capacities in clear violation of the Constitution.\n\nInitially, Millett’s fierce questioning seemed to be for naught. Later that day, Kavanaugh and Henderson crafted a nonsensical order that further postponed Doe’s abortion, requiring her to acquire a sponsor before exercising her right to choose. In response, Millett wrote a searing dissent lambasting both her colleagues and the government. “There are no winners in cases like this,” Millett began:\n\nBut there sure are losers. As of today, J.D. has already been forced by the government to continue an unwanted pregnancy for almost four weeks, and now, as a result of this order, must continue to carry that pregnancy for multiple more weeks. Forcing her to continue an unwanted pregnancy just in the hopes of finding a sponsor that has not been found in the past six weeks sacrifices J.D.’s constitutional liberty, autonomy, and personal dignity for no justifiable governmental reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith remarkable clarity given the time constraints, Millett explained why the government may not, consistent with the Due Process Clause, block Doe’s abortion. “The United States argues that a federal government official in Washington, D.C.” can control Doe’s medical decisions, she wrote:\n\nNo judicial bypass exists for that federal official’s decision. That is an astonishing power grab, and it flies in the teeth of decades of Supreme Court precedent preserving and protecting the fundamental right of a woman to make an informed choice whether to continue a pregnancy at this early stage.\n\nMillett also attacked an amicus brief filed by the Texas attorney general arguing that undocumented immigrants like Doe are not “persons” under the Constitution and thus have no rights. “The implications of amici’s argument,” she wrote, are “deeply troubling”:\n\nIf true, then that would mean she and everyone else here without lawful documentation … have no constitutional right to bodily integrity in any form. … They could be forced to have abortions. They could, if raped by government officials who hold them in detention, then be forced to carry any pregnancies to term. Even if pregnancy would kill the mother, the Constitution would turn a blind eye. Detainees would have no right to any medical treatment or protection from abuse by other detainees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“J.D. retains her basic rights to personhood,” Millett concluded.\n\nAfter all, this child fled here all alone in a desperate effort to avoid severe abuse. And, unfortunately, other women and girls desperate to escape abuse, sexual trafficking, and forced prostitution undoubtedly will also find themselves on our shores and pregnant. … When they decide that their dire circumstances leave them in no position to carry a pregnancy to term, the Constitution forbids the government from directly or effectively prohibiting their exercise of that right in the manner it has done here.\n\nThe dissent came down on Friday evening. On Sunday, armed with Millett’s opinion, the ACLU asked the full D.C. Circuit to vacate the panel decision and allow Doe to get an abortion. Two days later, the court rescinded the panel’s order by a 6–3 vote and ruled in Doe’s favor. In an extraordinary and unusual move, the court did not issue a majority opinion. Instead, it simply wrote that it agreed with Millett. In just four days, her opinion had been transformed from a dissent into the law.\n\nBut Millett wasn’t finished. Kavanaugh, clearly furious about the sudden reversal of fortune, dissented from Tuesday’s order, complaining that the government had a substantial interest in “seeking to place the minor in a better place when deciding” whether “to make a major life decision.” Millett retorted that “J.D. has already made her decision, and neither the government nor the dissenting opinion identifies a constitutionally sufficient justification … for requiring J.D. to wait for what may or may not be a better environment.”\n\nWant More SCOTUS? Subscribe to Amicus. Join Dahlia Lithwick and her stable of standout guests for a discussion about the high court and the country’s most important cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe also scorned Kavanaugh’s paternalistic suggestion that, with a “support network of friends and family,” Doe might back out of the abortion. She pointed out that Doe had already received judicial bypass, as required by Texas law, to terminate her pregnancy. “Unfortunately, the central reason for the bypass process,” Millett wrote, “is that pregnant girls and women too often find themselves [in] dangerous situations … in which those networks have broken down.” Condescending judges like Kavanaugh do not get to force these women to chat with their “network” to delay “the exercise of reproductive choice.” (Henderson, too, wrote a dissent to Tuesday’s ruling, arguing that Doe does not qualify as a “person” under the Due Process Clause. Millett chose not to re-engage with this outrageously wrongheaded, Dred Scott–esque assertion, which she had already countered in her first dissent.)\n\n“The court today,” Millett concluded, “correctly recognizes that J.D.’s unchallenged right under the Due Process Clause affords this 17-year-old a modicum of the dignity, sense of self-worth, and control over her own destiny that life seems to have so far denied her.”', 'The Democrats\' Next Supreme Court Nominee', -0.2, 31.2),

The agency oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors who enter the United States illegally and had refused her requests for an abortion.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday restored a lower court’s ruling against HHS. The new ruling ordered HHS to step aside and allow the teen to go forward with an abortion.\n\nThe Trump administration did not appeal to the Supreme Court before the procedure, but advocates for the teen — referred to in court filings as Jane Doe to shield her identity — rushed to arrange the abortion after the ruling Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m relieved for Jane Doe, but I’m so incredibly frustrated that we had to go through all of this for what is a very well-settled constitutional right,” Brigitte Amiri, an ACLU lawyer who argued for the teen in court, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe teen illegally entered the U.S. in September and learned she was pregnant while in federal custody in Texas. She obtained a state court order on Sept. 25 permitting an abortion. But federal officials refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others could take her for the procedure.\n\nHHS argued it had established a policy of “refusing to facilitate” abortions for people in its care. Government lawyers said the teen could ask to be returned to her country of origin instead of seeking an abortion while in HHS’ custody.\n\nLawyers for the teen said government officials were illegally denying medical care to which the teen was entitled, and that the shelter had instead taken her to a crisis pregnancy center. Such centers try to discourage pregnant women from having abortions.\n\nThe ACLU sued HHS last year, during the Obama administration, over its funding of facilities run by religiously affiliated groups that oppose abortion. But Amiri said the agency has been far more active under the Trump administration in trying to intervene in individual cases and stop abortions.\n\nIn emails released by the ACLU, Scott Lloyd, the head of HHS’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors, is quoted telling a subordinate in March that its facilities “should not be supporting abortion services pre or post-release.” Lloyd is quoted in other emails asking about the specific case of another pregnant teenager and offering to find a “few good families” to “see her through her pregnancy.”\n\nThe teen’s case “is a canary in the coal mine,” Amiri said. “It is emblematic of what is to come.”\n\nJane’s Due Process, a Texas group that works with minors seeking abortions, said it and other groups had raised private money to pay for the teen’s abortion. It said lawyers appointed to represent the teen’s interests would take her from the South Texas facility where she was being held to and from an abortion clinic.\n\nLawyers for the teen have not identified her name or country of origin, citing privacy reasons, but have said she was from Central America. But they said the teen feared having her parents find out that she wanted an abortion because she had seen them abuse a sister who was pregnant.\n\nThe teen was about 15 weeks pregnant, and Texas law bans most abortions after 20 weeks.\n\n“It shouldn’t take dozens of lawyers for anyone to get an abortion, and that’s what it took in this case,” said Susan Hays, legal director for Jane’s Due Process.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued in court filings that the teen did not have a constitutional right to an abortion, called the case “tragic” and argued it could “pave the way for anyone outside the United States to unlawfully enter and obtain an abortion.” Paxton noted in his statement that the U.S. Department of Justice did not appeal the circuit court’s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHHS and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'Immigrant teen has abortion after federal appeals court rules in her favor, ACLU says', -0.4, 13.8),

Schneiderman, one of 14 Democratic attorneys general who filed a court brief in support of the girl, said the group stands “ready to support every other Jane Doe fighting for the fundamental right to make her own health care decisions.”\n\nThe Trump administration said in court that it has a new policy of refusing to “facilitate” abortions for unaccompanied minors taken into federal custody after crossing the border illegally.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the teen, said that policy violates the minors’ constitutional right to an abortion in the United States.\n\nHundreds of pregnant undocumented immigrants have been in federal custody in recent years, according to court filings.\n\n“Justice prevailed today for Jane Doe. But make no mistake about it, the administration’s efforts to interfere in women’s decisions won’t stop with Jane,” said Brigitte Amiri, the ACLU attorney who argued the case in court.\n\n[Appeals court delays abortion for undocumented teen]\n\nThe abortion on Wednesday followed a roller-coaster legal battle that moved swiftly through the courts, with judges issuing contradictory rulings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit took the unusual step of reversing a three-judge panel of the same court without first holding oral argument.\n\nThe panel’s decision, issued Friday, would have postponed the abortion.\n\nInstead, the D.C. Circuit’s 6-to-3 ruling sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who hours later reissued an earlier order requiring the government to let the teen have the abortion “promptly and without delay.”\n\nHer guardians rushed to arrange transportation to the nearest abortion provider. The Justice Department mulled whether to ask the Supreme Court to put the D.C. Circuit order on hold.\n\nGovernment lawyers, who did not immediately ask for a hold after the Tuesday ruling, may have miscalculated how quickly the teen could receive an abortion.\n\nTexas law requires counseling from a doctor at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion, but the 17-year-old underwent that counseling Oct. 19, allowing her to go forward with the procedure once Chutkan issued her order.\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court opened for business Wednesday, it appears there was no issue left for the justices to decide.\n\nThe teen was more than 15 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy was terminated. Texas bars abortions, except in the case of a medical emergency, after 20 weeks. In her statement, the teen expressed frustration that the government earlier took her to a Christian pregnancy center, where workers urged her to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n“They made me see a doctor that tried to convince me not to abort and to look at sonograms,” she said. “People I don’t even know are trying to make me change my mind.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have pressed Eric Hargan, acting secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, about why the Trump administration changed federal policy to block access to abortions for minors in custody.\n\nHHS, which is responsible for caring for detained unaccompanied minors, has said the government is trying to “promote child birth and fetal life.” Scott Lloyd, who directs the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, has personally intervened to try to persuade unaccompanied minor girls not to have abortions, according to HHS.\n\nHHS officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday. Lloyd is slated to testify Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on immigration and border security on unrelated immigration issues. He could also be asked about the abortion case.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit’s ruling on Tuesday to allow the abortion was opposed by the court’s three active judges nominated to the bench by Republican presidents. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh said the majority had created a new right for undocumented immigrant minors in custody to “immediate abortion on demand.”\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson went further in a separate dissent finding that the undocumented teenager had no constitutional right to an elective abortion. “To conclude otherwise rewards lawlessness and erases the fundamental difference between citizenship and illegal presence in our country,” she wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the undocumented teenager had asked the full appeals court to rehear her case after the three-judge panel ruled 2 to 1 to give HHS until Oct. 31 to find a sponsor to take custody of the girl. That would have allowed her to be released and to seek the abortion without government involvement.\n\nGovernment lawyers told the court that prospective sponsors had inquired about the teenager.

Whitford told the Supreme Court earlier this month, \"gerrymanders now are not your father\'s gerrymander.\" This case challenges the extreme partisan gerrymander of the 2011 map for districts in the Wisconsin state legislature.\n\nFull disclosure: I signed an amicus brief in Gill with 11 other constitutional and election law scholars arguing that the Wisconsin map violated the First Amendment. The argument was based on the First Amendment\'s right of free association. Not only does someone have the right to join with others to exercise political influence, such as joining a political party, but a person has the right not to be discriminated against because of their tie to that organization. I was in good company in trying to persuade the court. More than 50 amicus briefs have been filed in the case. The reason everyone wants to get a word in is because Gill could set the standards and rules for how district lines are drawn in the future.\n\nThe origins of the case lie in secret Wisconsin state legislative electoral maps drawn by Republicans, who controlled both houses of the legislature, after the 2010 census. Democratic lawmakers (and even some Republicans) were shut out of the process. Litigation in the lower courts revealed that the maps were revised multiple times so the Republicans would gain maximum partisan advantage. The three-judge panel that first heard the case found the Wisconsin map violated the constitution and then ordered the legislature to redraw the map. That effort was put on hold as the matter went to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Gerrymandering\" is the pejorative word used to describe the drawing of district lines that favor one party or another. One of the ways gerrymanders can thwart the will of the voters is when district lines are drawn in such a way that minority of voters can wind up electing a super-majority of legislators. A clever gerrymander -- or many would argue -- a pernicious gerrymander can thwart the will of voters by allowing a minority (or a narrow majority) to elect a super-majority of legislators. This is precisely what happened in the 2012 and 2014 elections for the 99-seat Wisconsin Assembly. In 2012, Republicans won 60 Assembly seats despite winning only 48.6 percent of the two-party state-wide vote; in 2014, they won 63 seats with only 52 percent of the state-wide vote. Thus in its worst form, gerrymandering thwarts the democratic norm of majority rule.\n\nGerrymandering is also a source of incumbent protection and partisan advantage. When lawmakers draw their own lines, politicians pick their voter instead of the other way around. Politicians can look at voting patterns and cut out voters from neighborhoods that historically vote for the other party -- thereby creating skewed safe districts for incumbent politicians.\n\nBut courts have traditionally been reluctant to resolve redistricting disputes, heeding Justice Felix Frankfurter\'s 1946 warning that courts \"ought not to enter the political thicket.\" For most of American history, courts considered redistricting fights nonjusticiable -- meaning the courts would not hear them.\n\nBut state legislatures proved they could not be trusted with redistricting. By the time the Warren Court examined the results of decades of judicial neglect, they found states with such wildly different sized districts that voters\' votes literally had different weights. Over Frankfurter\'s vigorous dissent, the Court ruled in Baker v. Carr in 1962 that not only could the courts hear redistricting cases, it set the standard of \"one-person, one-vote,\" meaning that each district should have equal population.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also ruled that gerrymanders that favor a particular race are disallowed. But the court has struggled with the issue of whether partisan gerrymanders -- those that favor a particular party -- are also forbidden. Back in 2004, in Vieth v. Jubelirer, the court came close to ruling that partisan gerrymanders are nonjusticiable, but Justice Anthony Kennedy was not ready to totally close the courthouse door to such claims.\n\nWhich bring us back to Gill v. Whitford and its importance. Back in July, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Gill \"is perhaps the most important\" case the court has chosen to hear this term. At oral argument, Ginsburg again emphasized the stakes: \"I would like to ask you what\'s really behind all of this: The precious right to vote. If you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote? Whether it\'s a Democratic district or a Republican district, the result -- using this map, the result is preordained in most of the districts. … Would we have that result when the individual citizen says: I have no choice, I\'m in this district, and we know how this district is going to come out? I mean, that\'s something that this society should be concerned about?\"\n\nGill gives the Supreme Court a chance to decide whether courts can hear partisan gerrymandering claims, just in time for the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census. As Smith implored the Justices to recognize: \"we\'re here telling you [that] you are the only institution in the United States that can … solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse.\"', 'The Supreme Court Is the Only Institution in the US That Can Solve the Gerrymandering Problem', 0, 11.8),

The concern is not a new one for John Roberts. It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the public’s view.\n\n“It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,” he said then, adding: “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.”\n\nSo I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: “The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.”\n\nAnd assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal. The gap isn’t huge — 30 percent “too conservative” to 23 percent “too liberal” — but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant. In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, “too liberal” outstripped “too conservative” with a gap of 17 percent. Gallup’s analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third. In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.\n\nThe chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the court’s modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them. There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the court’s liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure. That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument. And I’d like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart. Whatever happens with this case — a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately — there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.\n\nIn the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the court’s hands on these issues. Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases. It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina. In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings. These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.\n\nThe Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court. When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Court’s door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the court’s interests are best served by sitting it out?', 'Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Court\'s Legitimacy?', -0.1, 13.9),

Some grow turnips. Until a local government stepped in, Chad Jarreau farmed dirt.\n\nTo be more precise, he dug up dirt on his property in Cut Off, Louisiana, graded it again and again and sold it for use in construction projects.\n\nJarreau is not a wealthy man, but he had a batch of dirt on the edge of his 17-acre property that was worth more than $150,000. Or it would have been, if the local flood-control district hadn’t taken it to shore up protection against hurricanes in the low-lying area that brushes up against the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJarreau, 44, knows all too well about flooding, having a lost a home on another property to Hurricane Katrina. But he also wants to be paid what he considers a fair price. So he’s asked the Supreme Court to step in. The justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case.\n\n“I’ve been digging on this land since I bought it,” Jarreau said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t think they could just take your land like that. I thought if they damaged your property, I thought they’d take care of it.”\n\nThe case raises a legal issue that the court hasn’t dealt with in nearly 70 years. The issue is whether the “just compensation” the Constitution says a government must pay when it takes someone’s property includes the value of the business that is lost because of the government’s action.\n\nLouisiana’s Supreme Court ruled against Jarreau. State supreme courts and federal courts are divided about whether governments must cover business losses when they take private property, said Robert McNamara, a lawyer for the libertarian Institute for Justice, representing Jarreau.\n\nThe South Lafourche Levee District is responsible for flood control in the portion of the 106-mile Bayou Lafourche that runs through Cut Off before eventually draining into the Gulf. The district took the dirt from just under an acre of Jarreau’s land as well as property from some neighbors, under Louisiana laws strengthened after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nWithout the levee system, Jarreau’s property would flood frequently, said Loulan Pitre Jr., a former state lawmaker who is the lawyer for the levee district. “There is a strong policy to say that this is all subject to flooding and it’s reasonable to expect a small sacrifice to protect everyone.”\n\nThe levee district certainly thought the sacrifice was small. It initially sent Jarreau a check for $1,326 after notifying him in 2011 that it was going to take the dirt from Jarreau’s land that was closest to the bayou.\n\nJarreau couldn’t believe the paltry sum and kept digging because he had a contract for 23,000 cubic yards (17,600 cubic meters) of dirt — enough to cover a football field nearly a foot deep — with a private company that does a lot of work on the levees in coastal Louisiana.\n\nBut then the levee district sued to make Jarreau stop digging. Their legal fight eventually went to trial. A judge ruled that Jarreau should be paid nearly $12,000 for the land itself and another $164,000 for his business losses. At the end of the state appeals process, Jarreau was left with just the $12,000.\n\nMany properties in the bayous are long rectangles, with the lowest ground near the water and higher land at the other end.\n\nIt’s the property nearest the water, what the locals call the back of their tracts, that can be used for flood control.\n\nJarreau said he didn’t know that before his six-year-long legal fight.\n\n“I dug up pretty much the whole property. I started in the front. I would have started in the back,” he said.', 'Louisiana \'dirt farmer\' asks US Supreme Court\'s help', 0, 7.9);

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The Associated Press\n\nBy MARK SHERMAN, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Some residents in bayou country deep in southeastern Louisiana raise alligators or crawfish. Some grow turnips. Until a local government stepped in, Chad Jarreau farmed dirt.\n\nTo be more precise, he dug up dirt on his property in Cut Off, Louisiana, graded it again and again and sold it for use in construction projects.\n\nJarreau is not a wealthy man, but he had a batch of dirt on the edge of his 17-acre (7-hectare) property that was worth more than $150,000. Or it would have been, if the local flood control district hadn\'t taken it to shore up protection against hurricanes in the low-lying area that brushes up against the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJarreau, 44, knows all too well about flooding, having a lost a home on another property to Hurricane Katrina. But he also wants to be paid what he considers a fair price. So he\'s asked the Supreme Court to step in. The justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case.\n\n\"I\'ve been digging on this land since I bought it,\" Jarreau said in a telephone interview. \"I didn\'t think they could just take your land like that. I thought if they damaged your property, I thought they\'d take care of it.\"\n\nThe case raises a legal issue that the court hasn\'t dealt with in nearly 70 years. The issue is whether the \"just compensation\" the Constitution says a government must pay when it takes someone\'s property includes the value of the business that is lost because of the government\'s action.\n\nLouisiana\'s Supreme Court ruled against Jarreau. State supreme courts and federal courts are divided about whether governments must cover business losses when they take private property, said Robert McNamara, a lawyer for the libertarian Institute for Justice, representing Jarreau.\n\nThe South Lafourche Levee District is responsible for flood control in the portion of the 106-mile (171-kilometer) Bayou Lafourche that runs through Cut Off before eventually draining into the Gulf. The district took the dirt from just under an acre of Jarreau\'s land as well as property from some neighbors, under Louisiana laws strengthened after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nWithout the levee system, Jarreau\'s property would flood frequently, said Loulan Pitre Jr., a former state lawmaker who is the lawyer for the levee district. \"There is a strong policy to say that this is all subject to flooding and it\'s reasonable to expect a small sacrifice to protect everyone.\"\n\nThe levee district certainly thought the sacrifice was small. It initially sent Jarreau a check for $1,326 after notifying him in 2011 that it was going to take the dirt from Jarreau\'s land that was closest to the bayou.\n\nJarreau couldn\'t believe the paltry sum and kept digging because he had a contract for 23,000 cubic yards (17,600 cubic meters) of dirt — enough to cover a football field nearly a foot deep — with a private company that does a lot of work on the levees in coastal Louisiana.\n\nBut then the levee district sued to make Jarreau stop digging. Their legal fight eventually went to trial. A judge ruled that Jarreau should be paid nearly $12,000 for the land itself and another $164,000 for his business losses. At the end of the state appeals process, Jarreau was left with just the $12,000.\n\nMany properties in the bayous are long rectangles, with the lowest ground near the water and higher land at the other end.\n\nIt\'s the property nearest the water, what the locals call the back of their tracts, that can be used for flood control.\n\nJarreau said he didn\'t know that before his six-year-long legal fight.\n\n\"I dug up pretty much the whole property. I started in the front. I would have started in the back,\" he said.', 'Louisiana \'Dirt Farmer\' Asks Supreme Court\'s Help', 0, 7.7),

Savage', '2017-10-27', 'The Supreme Court is weighing whether to hear an anti-abortion group’s challenge on free speech grounds to a California law that requires “crisis pregnancy centers” — which advocate alternatives to the procedure — to also advise clients that the state offers free or low-cost contraception and assistance in ending their pregnancy.\n\nThe justices could announce as early as Monday whether they will hear the case, the latest in a series of clashes pitting the 1st Amendment against the state’s power to regulate the medical profession.\n\nThe California Legislature said two years ago that it was concerned that the more than 200 pregnancy centers in California sometimes provided “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices that often confuse, misinform and even intimidate women from making fully informed decisions” about their medical care. The so-called Reproductive FACT Act requires these centers to disclose whether they have medical professionals on the staff and to inform patients that the state offers subsidized contraception and abortion.\n\nLast year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law against claims that the disclosures were a kind of “compelled speech” that violated the 1st Amendment.\n\nBut three separate appeals are pending before the Supreme Court, including one from the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which says it has “over 110 nonprofit, pro-life pregnancy centers” in California.\n\nAt issue is whether “the state of California can compel nonprofit, faith-based, pro-life licensed medical facilities, against their religious convictions and identity, to advertise a government program that provides free or low-cost abortions,” wrote Jay Alan Sekulow, counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice and a personal attorney for President Trump.\n\nAppealing on behalf of the LivingWell Medical Clinic and two others, Sekulow said the disclosure law violates “the principle that one cannot be conscripted into acting as a ventriloquist’s dummy for a government message.”\n\nThe justices have considered the appeals for more than three weeks in their weekly conferences, suggesting at least several of them are inclined to hear the cases.\n\nRecently, lower courts have split on controversies arising from state regulations of medical professionals.\n\nIn a case dubbed “Docs vs. Glocks,” an appeals court in February struck down a Florida law that told doctors they could not question patients about whether they kept firearms at home. The National Rifle Assn. had pressed for the law, but the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta ruled its restrictions violated the free-speech rights of physicians.\n\nSounding the same theme, judges struck down a North Carolina law that would have required doctors before performing an abortion to display for the woman a sonogram of the fetus and to describe the image. “This compelled speech provision violates the 1st Amendment,” the 4th Circuit ruled three years ago.\n\nAnd in a case that is closest to the pending appeal from California, an appeals court in 2014 struck down most of a New York City ordinance that required pregnancy centers to notify patients whether they “provide [abortions] or provide referrals for abortion.” The 2nd Circuit Court said this provision “mandates discussion of a controversial political topic” and is therefore unconstitutional. However, the judges agreed the city could require these centers to disclose whether they had licensed medical professionals available.\n\nBy contrast, the 9th Circuit based in San Francisco has given the state more leeway to regulate the medical profession.\n\nFour years ago, the judges rejected a free-speech challenge to the state law that banned medical providers from offering gay conversion therapy or “sexual orientation change efforts” to patients under age 18. The appeals court said the law “regulates conduct,” not speech. “It bans a form of medical treatment for minors. It does nothing to prevent therapists from discussing the pros and cons of SOCE with their patients,” wrote Judge Susan Graber.\n\nThe last year, a different panel of 9th Circuit judges relied on that decision in upholding the law requiring the religiously affiliated pregnancy centers to post a disclosure notice in the waiting room or to give patients a printed copy. It says, “California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care and abortion for eligible women.” The notice includes a telephone number for the county social services office.\n\nIn a 3-0 ruling, the judges said the state has ample authority to regulate “professional speech” to protect the welfare of patients. The disclosure notice does not “encourage, suggest or imply” that women should seek abortion, wrote Judge Dorothy Nelson. It is “closely drawn to achieve California’s interests in safeguarding public health and fully informing Californians of the existence of publicly funded medical services.” Also upheld were separate provisions that require the centers to notify clients if they are not state licensed and disclose whether they have medical professionals available to provide advice or care.\n\nLawyers for California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra advised the court to turn away the appeal in the case of NIFLA vs. Becerra. The notice rules “fall well within the 1st Amendment’s tolerance for the regulation of the practice-related speech of licensed professionals,” they said.\n\nIf the court agrees to hear the challenge to California’s clinic-disclosure law, it would be the second major case before the high court this term that arises as a conservative 1st Amendment challenge to a liberal state law — and it comes from the same lawyers.\n\nThe Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom, which appealed on behalf of NIFLA, also represents the Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The baker seeks a free-speech exemption to the state’s civil rights laws. The high court will hear his case in December.\n\nMajor questions before the Supreme Court this fall »\n\nCAPTION Las Vegas had had to carefully consider how it markets itself after the Oct. 1 mass shooting.

Petitioners have agreed to cede ten minutes of argument time to the United States and therefore consent to this motion.\n\n“The question presented is whether that application of Colorado law violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as applied to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n“The United States has filed a brief as amicus curiae supporting petitioners, contending that, in the circumstances of this case, the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause bars the application of Colorado’s public accommodations law to petitioners.”\n\nIt continues: “As a general matter, the United States has a substantial interest in the preservation of federal constitutional rights of free expression.\n\n“In addition, the United States has a particular interest in the scope of such rights in the context of the Colorado statute here, which shares certain features with federal public accommodations laws, including Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\n“The United States is thus well positioned to address the reconciliation of content-neutral public accommodations laws with federal constitutional freedoms of speech and expression. Participation by the United States in oral argument would therefore materially assist the Court in its consideration of this case.”\n\nA ruling in favour of the baker could have a chilling effect on LGBT rights protections country-wide, and equality activists fear it may end up creating a license for homophobic discrimination based on religion.\n\nThe case is expected to be close, with Trump’s newly-appointed Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch considered a firm vote for the baker’s freedom to discriminate.\n\nThe Trump administration itself has filed an amicus brief backing the freedom to discriminate.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department claimed that a ruling against the bakery could create an “intrusion” against the First Amendment “where a public accommodations law compels someone to create expression for a particular person or entity and to participate, literally or figuratively, in a ceremony or other expressive event.”\n\n86 Republican members of congress have also signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court supporting the baker’s right to discriminate.\n\nThe gay couple in the case, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, have vowed to stand up for equality.\n\nThey said: “This has always been about more than a cake. Businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love.\n\n“While we’re disappointed that the courts continue debating the simple question of whether LGBT people deserve to be treated like everyone else, we hope that our case helps ensure that no one has to experience being turned away simply because of who they are.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Colorado represent Mullins and Craig in the case.\n\nJames Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBT Project, said: “The law is squarely on David and Charlie’s side because when businesses are open to the public, they’re supposed to be open to everyone.\n\n“While the right to one’s religious beliefs is fundamental, a license to discriminate is not.\n\n“Same-sex couples like David and Charlie deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else, and we’re ready to take that fight all the way to the Supreme Court.”\n\nThe baker is defended by hardline anti-LGBT law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, which has sought to undermine LGBT rights protections in a number of states.\n\nThough the ADF is framing the issue around a religious objection to same-sex marriage, their other cases show a much wider support for licensing anti-LGBT discrimination.\n\nFor instance, they have sued a school district over a transgender non-discrimination policy, and defended a T-shirt printer who refused an order from a Pride celebration.\n\nBritish MPs recently accused Donald Trump of “undermining” work on global LGBTI rights by pursuing a regressive agenda.\n\nAt a debate in the UK’s House of Commons yesterday, politicians from across parties voiced concern at developments in the United States on LGBT issues.\n\nLabour MP Stephen Twigg said: “I want to say something about what is happening in the United States of America. President Trump’s decision to ban transgender people from the US military is an enormous shame, one I hope we can condemn on a cross-party basis.\n\n“I pay tribute to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in America for his positive and measured response to President Trump’s actions. I urge our Government to do all they can to press President Trump to think again on his attempt to ban trans people from the US armed forces.\n\n“That, however, is not the only incident of greater homophobia and transphobia in American politics and policy. Recently, the United States voted against a UN Human Rights Council resolution that condemned the use of the death penalty against people because they are LGBT.\n\n“President Obama left a very positive legacy on LGBT. Tragically, President Trump is undoing it.\n\n“That leaves a vacuum in global LGBT rights. I hope that the United Kingdom, working with like-minded countries around the world, will play a leadership role to ensure we do not slip back, but instead move forward to global LGBT equality.”', 'Trump administration heads to Supreme Court to support \'freedom\' to discriminate against gay ...', -0.3, 16.3),

The operation of the PTAB has resulted in incalculable damage to American innovation by invalidating more than 90% of patent claims subjected to PTAB review. This wholesale annihilation of patent claims even lead Randall Rader – former Chief Judge of the nation’s patent appeals court – to dub the PTAB a “patent death squad” for American patents. The destruction of patent property rights by the PTAB also resulted in a 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis of national patent systems ranking the U.S. patent system as 10th in the world (tied with Hungary); previously, the U.S. patent system had been ranked number one.\n\nEven worse for the American economy and for American technological competitiveness, the inability of American inventors to secure meaningful patent protection for their innovations as a result of the PTAB has led to a marked decline in entrepreneurs starting new businesses. The slump in start-up activity has far-reaching implications for the American economy because start-up businesses have historically been the key drivers in this country of job creation and in the development of cutting-edge technology. As long as the PTAB continues in its mission of invalidating the vast majority of patent claims that it reviews, the reluctance of American inventors to start new businesses and for venture capitalists to invest in these new enterprises will undoubtedly continue.\n\n“Patent rights are grounded in the U.S. Constitution which authorized Congress “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to…inventors the exclusive right to their…discoveries.” “The foresight of the Founding Father in establishing strong patent rights spurred American economic development throughout our history and were critical to technological breakthroughs in fields ranging from transportation and communications to pharmaceuticals.” notes Paul Morinville, the CEO of U.S. Inventor and himself a named inventor on more than 30 U.S. patents and patent applications. “The PTAB has devastated this engine of American prosperity by invalidating patent claims at an alarming rate. Even worse, the PTAB suffers from serious due process issues, including, conflicts of interest by review panel members; “stacking” of review panels to produce desired results; abuses in the consideration of supplementary evidence; denial of patent owners’ ability to respond to arguments against invalidity allegations; and arbitrary and capricious denials of patent holders’ right to amend claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has an opportunity in the Oil States case to undo this damage by declaring the AIA unconstitutional. U.S. Inventor is holding this protest to highlight to the justices and to the public the vital need to abolish the PTAB in order to protect American inventors and American innovation.” added Paul Morinville.\n\nFor further information about U.S. Inventor and to register to participate in this protest, please visit us at: http://www.usinventor.org/oil-states-protest/', 'Protest in Support of American Inventors at the US Supreme Court on November 27th During Oral ...', -0.1, 6.1),

Wade decision legalizing abortion.\n\nU.S. District Judge Myron Thompson in the Middle District of Alabama found the laws unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the state from enforcing the measures, which were signed into law in May 2016 by former Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican.\n\nThe same court last year temporarily blocked both measures in a preliminary injunction, which was under appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe school-proximity law banned clinics within 2,000 feet of a K-8 public school and was the only law of its kind in the United States. Thompson said it would likely have forced the closing of clinics in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa, where 72 percent of the state’s abortions are performed.\n\nThe “fetal-demise law,” which effectively banned the most common method of second-trimester abortion, known as dilation and evacuation, would have prohibited abortions after 15 weeks, Thompson wrote.\n\n“Because these laws clearly impose an impermissible undue burden on a woman’s ability to choose an abortion, they cannot stand,” he wrote.\n\nThe ACLU of Alabama had challenged the laws on behalf of two women’s health clinics in a state where abortion providers have faced what Thompson’s ruling called a “climate of hostility.”\n\n“Both would have had a devastating impact on the ability of women to access abortion in Alabama,” said Randall Marshall, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama.\n\nAlabama’s Attorney General and Republican Governor Kay Ivey’s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. state legislatures enacted 41 new abortion restrictions in the first half of 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.\n\nThose laws have led to a spate of legal challenges in Alabama and elsewhere.

Moore believes the flag represents state-sanctioned hate speech that violates the equal-protection rights of black citizens. He referred to the flag as a \"Jim Crow banner\" in his legal response.\n\nMoore compared the Mississippi flag to the Brown v. Board of Education decision by the Supreme Court, which decided schools violated the Constitution by providing a message of inequality to the state of Kansas, creating a \"feeling of inferiority…that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\"\n\nMoore appealed two legal losses in Mississippi to the Supreme Court, which has not taken the case but asked for both sides to submit arguments—a possible first step toward a full argument. It would be the first time the Supreme Court has weighed in on the Confederate symbol if they choose to take up the case. Previous legal decisions have said Moore failed to prove the flag causes \"identifiable legal injury.\"\n\nThe state argued to the Supreme Court on October 18 that while the Mississippi flag may be deeply offensive to black people, it is not a violation of civil rights.

Patterson', '2017-10-27', 'The extraterritorial reach of U.S. law enforcement will face scrutiny once more, with the Supreme Court granting certiorari this month in the highly-publicized—and hotly-contested—dispute over a warrant for Microsoft emails stored on a foreign server. United States v. Microsoft, No. 17-2 (cert. granted Oct. 16, 2017). The case highlights a recurring tension between public safety and privacy concerns, and underscores the increasing complexity behind the technology we all rely on each day.\n\nIn the last round of the Microsoft saga, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court and quashed a warrant for emails of a criminal suspect that were stored on a Dublin server. Microsoft v. United States, 829 F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2016) (Microsoft). The panel concluded that execution of the warrant would involve an impermissible extraterritorial application of the Stored Communications Act (SCA). Nearly 90 amici, including technology and media companies, civil liberties groups, and governments, had submitted briefs to the circuit and its decision was divisive, even internally: An en banc rehearing was denied by a split 4-4 vote, with strong dissents questioning the merits and implications of the original opinion. Microsoft v. United States, 14-2985 (2d Cir. Jan. 24, 2017). All called for a legislative fix.\n\nSince then, Congress held hearings on law enforcement access to foreign-stored data, but no other circuit court reached the issue. (Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Across Borders: Facilitating Cooperation and Protecting Rights: Hearing before the S. Judiciary Subcomm. on Crime and Terrorism (May 24, 2017); Data Stored Abroad: Ensuring Lawful Access and Privacy Protection in the Digital Era: Hearing before the H. Judiciary Comm. (June 15, 2017)). The various district courts that addressed it, however, roundly disagreed with the Second Circuit’s ruling. According to the government’s petition, service providers are nonetheless resisting SCA warrants based on Microsoft, impeding law enforcement and public safety. While legislative efforts may continue in parallel, the Supreme Court appears to agree that urgency exists to hear the dispute now, even in the absence of a formal circuit split.\n\nBackground\n\nAt issue is §2703 of the SCA, a multi-provision statute that is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. 18 U.S.C. §§2701-2712. The SCA generally affords Fourth Amendment-like protections to electronic communications and prohibits unauthorized access to or disclosure of such information. Section 2703, however, permits the government to use warrants, subpoenas, or court orders to compel disclosure from service providers. Of these options, the government is required to obtain a warrant, on a probable cause showing, for communications stored for less than 180 days. The government can also use a warrant for longer-stored data or else seek such data by subpoena, but only with notice to the accountholder. 18 U.S.C. §2703.\n\nThe service provider here—Microsoft—was served with a §2703 warrant at its U.S. headquarters for “content” and “non-content” information about an email accountholder. As is increasingly common, Microsoft had procedures in place to optimize efficiency by breaking up the electronic account data and storing it in different physical locations. Most of the data, including the content of the emails, automatically migrated to a server in Dublin because the accountholder inputted the country code for Ireland. The email contents could, however, be “collected” and viewed by certain Microsoft employees in the United States.\n\nMicrosoft moved to quash the warrant for the Dublin-stored data on the grounds that it would constitute an impermissible extraterritorial search and seizure. The magistrate judge denied Microsoft’s motion, and the district court affirmed. On appeal, the circuit quashed the warrant, and the government’s writ petition followed.\n\nQuestions for the Court\n\nThe court’s review will begin with at least one area of agreement between the parties: Section 2703 does not provide for extraterritorial application. Indeed, U.S. statutes are presumed not to apply extraterritorially unless otherwise indicated, and the presumption has not been rebutted here. Morrison v. National Australian Bank, 561 U.S. 247 (2010). The court instead will evaluate whether, as the government contends, the Microsoft warrant involves a permissible domestic application of the statute. That question turns on the statute’s focus, and whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred within the United States. RJR Nabisco v. European Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2101 (2016).\n\nThe SCA’s focus is disputed. The circuit held that the language of the SCA and its legislative history make clear that its focus is privacy, and that the relevant conduct is Microsoft’s accessing data located in Ireland. The government’s petition agrees that certain SCA provisions address privacy, but contends that §2703’s focus is disclosure, namely “disclosure in the United States of information that the provider can access domestically with the click of a computer mouse.” The government contends that even if §2703’s focus was privacy, the domestic disclosures are still the relevant conduct; Microsoft does not violate its users’ privacy by internally accessing their data. In any case, the government maintains that privacy interests are protected by the warrant’s probable cause requirement. Petition for Writ of Certiorari (Petition), at 12, 17, 31.\n\nThe very nature of §2703 warrants is also disputed. The magistrate and district judge concluded that SCA warrants, despite their name and probable cause requirements, function more like subpoenas: they require service providers, rather than law enforcement, to gather the requested materials. Subpoena law requires recipients under U.S. jurisdiction to produce information in their possession, custody, and control regardless of its location, leading the lower courts to enforce the Microsoft warrant. On appeal, the circuit held that §2703 clearly distinguishes between subpoenas and warrants, and noted that warrants have “distinctly territorial” limitations. Moreover, the circuit noted that “our Court has never upheld the use of a subpoena to compel a recipient to produce an item under its control and located overseas when the recipient is merely a caretaker for another individual or entity and that individual, not the subpoena recipient, has a protectable privacy interest in the item.” Microsoft, 829 F.3d at 212-16 (citation omitted).\n\nWhose Data Is It Anyway?\n\nIn the government’s view, service providers “control” all accountholder data and must produce requested data regardless of where they choose to store it. But as the circuit noted, such service providers may be more like “caretakers” of data and bound to consider the underlying accountholder’s separate privacy interest. The scope of that interest, in turn, may depend on the identity of the particular user. As the circuit observed, the record is silent on the location and nationality of the Microsoft user who sparked all this litigation. But such details may matter as the court (and Congress) assess these issues.\n\nFor example, in a joint amicus brief supporting the government’s petition, thirty-three states and Puerto Rico represented that service providers have refused to comply with SCA warrants post-Microsoft “even when (1) a court has found probable cause that the email account was used in connection with a domestic crime, (2) the provider can access the requested data from within the United States, and (3) the suspect and the provider are both in the United States.” Brief Amici Curiae of the States of Vermont, et al. in Support of Petitioner, at 3 (emphasis added). In its petition, the government made a similar representation, noting that the “harmful effects of the panel’s decision [] extend beyond investigations involving the email of foreign nationals.” The government added that the Microsoft decision “provides a roadmap for terrorists and criminals in the United States to insulate electronic communications from U.S. investigators—they need do nothing more than falsely state a location outside the United States when signing up for an account.” Petition, at 27.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Congress intended such a result or foresaw it, given the vastly different technology that existed at the SCA’s 1986 passage. The analysis is muddier, however, as to foreign residents and nationals, given traditional warrants’ territorial limits and the potential tensions between U.S. and foreign laws, especially on privacy. Perhaps a starting point, as some have suggested, is to focus on users’ nationality and residence, rather than the location of their data, which may be unconnected for business or technological reasons. See, e.g., Testimony of Richard Salgado, Director, Law Enforcement and Information Security, Google.\n\nConclusion\n\nStakeholders affected by the Microsoft decision agree that serious competing policy considerations must be weighed to align the SCA with modern technology and the increasing importance of digital evidence to law enforcement—not just in the United States, but worldwide. Indeed, any legislative remedies must take into account the parallel data requests made by foreign governments and the potentially conflicting international compliance demanded of service providers. In the meantime, all eyes will be on the Supreme Court as they review the thorny Microsoft issues anew.\n\nPhilip Patterson and Vera Kachnowski practice white-collar criminal defense and international investigations at De Feis O’Connell & Rose, P.C., a Manhattan law firm.', 'Battle Over Emails Stored Overseas Reaches Supreme Court', 0, 13.9);

(Doug Mills/The New York Times) - Bulletin\n\nA- A+\n\nPublic employee unions in Oregon and elsewhere may face a terrible blow to membership from the U.S. Supreme Court. Oregon unions are already trying to lock people in the union, making it hard to leave and stop paying dues.\n\nOne of Oregon’s largest public employee unions, Service Employees International Union, has a provision that members can only withdraw from the union in a narrow 15-day window that opens once a year. Another of the state’s large public employee unions, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has a provision that is even narrower. It’s 10 days. And what makes those windows more complicated is that when they occur can vary from worker to worker.\n\nApparently the unions are eager to fight for workers, except they want to fight workers who want to leave with their own money.\n\nThe new court case driving union concern is Janus v. AFSCME. The heart of the case is the ability of unions to require government employees to subsidize a union as a condition of working for their government. Unions argue that workers benefit from union negotiations, so it’s only fair that they should pay their share for the representation.\n\nBut the plaintiff in the case argues that requiring any sort of compulsory fee for labor negotiations violates the First Amendment. Labor negotiations are a form of political activity. The debate over the cost and size of government is directly related to negotiations over wages and benefits. So why should anyone be compelled to pay for negotiations they don’t agree with?\n\nThe Supreme Court seemed about to rule against the unions in a similar case in 2015, but then Justice Antonin Scalia died. The court split 4-4. The new make-up of the court might lead to a ruling against the unions.\n\nUnions can still be strong if the court rules against them in Janus. But they will have to convince workers to participate, rather than compelling them to pay for representation they may not want.\n\n18577426', 'Editorial: Unions fight court and to prevent workers from leaving', -0.1, 5.1),

Known as mitigating evidence, such information is supposed to be provided to jurors before they decide whether a capital murder defendant deserves to take responsibility for the crime by being put to death.\n\nDuring a brief presentation in the punishment phase of Ayestas’ trial, the only mitigating evidence presented by defense lawyers came from a Harris County Jail teacher who described the inmate as a serious and attentive student.\n\nRELATED: U.S. Supreme Court takes Ayestas death penalty case\n\nUnless the federal courts reverse their tightfisted policies and provide money for a specialized investigator, defense lawyers say, Ayestas will be executed without any judge or juror hearing evidence that could have resulted in a sentence of life in prison, not death.\n\nThe Texas case “will test our commitment to fair trials,” not only for Ayestas but for other death row inmates, said Brandon Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of the book “End of its Rope: How Killing the Death Penalty Can Revive Criminal Justice.”\n\n‘Catch-22’ situation\n\nThe issue before the Supreme Court revolves around the U.S. Criminal Justice Act, which includes a provision ensuring that indigent death row inmates get court-provided money to hire investigators and experts who are “reasonably necessary” to pursue an appeal.\n\nAyestas requested a mitigation specialist to collect evidence that he argues should have been compiled by his trial lawyers and presented to his jury. That information could provide the evidence needed to show that his trial lawyers were deficient, requiring that Ayestas be given a new sentencing trial and a chance to ask jurors for a life sentence.\n\nAyestas’ request was rejected, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the inmate did not demonstrate a “substantial need” for the expert.\n\nDefense lawyers argue that the 5th Circuit Court’s “substantial need” requirement is improper — providing a tougher hurdle than the “reasonably necessary” standard in federal law — putting inmates in the “Catch-22” situation of having to show a court why the evidence is important before that evidence can be developed.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s top appellate lawyer, Solicitor General Scott Keller, plans to argue that the 5th Circuit Court has adopted a perfectly acceptable standard that mirrors similar legal requirements for death penalty appeals.\n\nThe standard allows judges to weed out weak claims that can drag out death penalty appeals, Texas officials told the Supreme Court in a brief, adding that the standard proposed by Ayestas’ lawyers “provides effectively no limit” on funding requests for appeals.\n\n“Petitioners are not entitled to funding to undertake fishing expeditions to discover claims that may or may not exist,” the Texas brief said.\n\nThe brief also said the lower court properly denied Ayestas’ request for a mitigation specialist.\n\nDefense lawyers must show a “substantial likelihood” that the information about Ayestas’ past would have prompted jurors to give him a life sentence instead of the death penalty, it said. But given the brutal nature of Paneque’s murder and other acts of violence by Ayestas, it is highly unlikely that evidence of mental illness, brain injuries or drug and alcohol abuse in his past would have changed the sentence, the Texas brief argued.\n\nDefense lawyers plan to argue that Texas officials have missed the point.\n\n“Courts do not rewrite statutes,” they told the Supreme Court. The law “means what it says: Courts should authorize services when they are reasonably — not substantially — necessary for the representation.”\n\nTexas death penalty cases\n\nA ruling is expected before the court’s term ends next summer, building on other recent decisions in Texas death penalty cases, including:\n\n• In February, the Supreme Court tossed out the death sentence given to Duane Buck, an African-American, because a defense expert testified at his trial that black men were more likely to commit violence. In a deal with prosecutors, Buck was sentenced to life in prison for capital murder in October after pleading guilty to two additional counts of attempted murder.\n\n• In March, the high court sided with death row inmate Bobby James Moore, ruling that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had ignored scientific advances on how to measure intellectual disabilities, creating “an unacceptable risk” that intellectually disabled Texans will be executed. The Supreme Court ordered the Texas court to re-evaluate Moore’s eligibility for the death penalty using appropriate measures of disability. That review is still underway.\n\n• In June, the Supreme Court ruled against death row inmate Erick Davila, upholding a 5th Circuit Court decision that limited inmates’ ability to challenge the effectiveness of appellate lawyers.\n\nBy far the nation’s most prolific death penalty state, Texas has executed six inmates in 2017 — Arkansas is second nationally with four — and there are four Texas executions scheduled through Jan. 30.', 'Supreme Court reviews another Texas death penalty case', -0.1, 10.3),

Berg of the University of St. Thomas. Prior to the gay marriage ruling, these two professors wrote a law review article advocating freedom for both these marriages and for religious conscience, a balancing act they now repeat in the Cakeshop case. Their brief cites the Bible, James Madison (from 1785) and 31 court precedents, posing significant points as follows:\n\nThe baker, Jack Phillips, does not discriminate and gladly serves gay customers except for weddings. Whether or not the state or the gay couple thinks so, the baker sees weddings as “inherently religious,” Colorado demanded participation in what he believes is sin and expected him to “repeatedly violate his conscience or permanently abandon his occupation.”\n\nThen this: Colorado violated not only religious freedom but the “establishment of religion” prohibition, because it forced Phillips’ “participation in a religious exercise,” something the Supreme Court forbids.\n\nYes, the baker’s refusal was an injury to the couple, but “tormenting” a dissenter’s conscience is also an injury.

It is the third time a case from the county has arrived before the Supreme Court this year.\n\n\"That tells you that there is a problem,\" said Robert Dunham, Executive Director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\n\"When you have three outlier practices in one jurisdiction in one year, it begins to look like a renegade county as opposed to just an outlier county.\"\n\n- Lack of expertise -\n\nThe American penal code stipulates a defendant has the right to counsel and \"reasonable necessary\" means for his or her defense -- in particular to fund investigations likely to establish mitigating circumstances.\n\nBut in the case of Ayestas, the \"trial counsel didn\'t do anything for almost a year and a half, until about a month before trial,\" according to Lee Kovarksy, who is arguing the case before the Supreme Court.\n\n\"A reasonable lawyer is supposed to look into this person\'s social history, get a mental health profile and figure out what the most effective mitigation case will be. None of that happens here.\"\n\nOnce Ayestas\' guilt was established, he added, it should have been asked whether someone like him belongs \"in the category of the worst of the worst.\"\n\n\"Do they deserve the death penalty in light of the circumstances in which they lived their life?\" Kovarsky said.\n\nHis view was echoed by Brandon Garett, professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\n\"The main job of a defense lawyer in a death penalty case is to give the jury a reason not to sentence someone to death,\" he said.\n\n- No reason not to sentence -\n\nFor Ayestas, he added, it was \"no surprise that the jury took 12 minutes to decide whether to sentence him to death.\"\n\n\"They had no reason to consider not to sentence him to death.\"\n\nIn order to challenge a person\'s detention following poor legal defense in the United States, a petition for habeas corpus can be filed -- arguing the person was detained against their constitutional rights.\n\nBut in Texas, the law complicates things for prisoners -- requiring lawyers to prove the sentence would have been different if the defendant had been better represented.\n\n\"You need a team to do capital defense. A lawyer alone is not enough,\" says Emily Olson-Gault -- director and chief counsel at the American Bar Association\'s Death Penalty Representation Project.\n\nSuch a team should include social workers, as well as investigators and funding for medical experts -- all of which were denied to Ayestas by the state of Texas.\n\nThese lawyers hope the Supreme Court will back the defense\'s argument that Ayestas was denied \"reasonable necessary\" means to investigate possible mitigating evidence.\n\nJuries in the past have been receptive to arguments related to mental health, even when faced with the most barbaric crimes.\n\nIn the case of James Holmes -- who opened fire in a Colorado movie theater 2012, killing 12 and wounding 70 -- evidence of dementia persuaded a jury to forego the the death penalty.', 'Poor legal defense the spotlight in death penalty case before the US Supreme Court', -0.1, 10),

They argue that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent, threatening national treasures such as the 24-foot Canadian Cross of Sacrifice and 13-foot Argonne Cross in Arlington National Cemetery — both within the Fourth Circuit’s jurisdiction — as well as the ground zero “cross,” the steel beams discovered among World Trade Center debris now on display in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.\n\n“It is brooding hostility toward religion, a sort of cleansing,” said Kelly Shackelford, the president of First Liberty Institute, one of the legal groups aiding the American Legion in defending the cross. “We would immediately need to begin massive bulldozing and sandblasting of veterans memorials across the country in a way that most people would find inconceivable.”\n\nIn his Fourth Circuit dissent, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory, first appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued that the Establishment Clause “does not require the government ‘to purge from the public sphere’ any reference to religion.”\n\nSupporters of the cross also argue that context is vital: The Peace Cross is displayed alongside an American flag, amid a park of memorials for veterans of various wars. Its four sides, they say, are marked prominently with patriotic, not religious, virtues: valor, endurance, courage and devotion. The fallen soldiers are listed on a tablet with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut opponents say it is hardly integrated: No other monument in the area is taller than 10 feet, and there are no other religious symbols in the park. They note that its fallen soldiers’ names are rusted away and obscured by bushes. And the cross has been the site of prayer gatherings as well as Veterans Day vigils — and even such vigils are often opened in prayer.\n\nTwo past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

After pushback, they had modified the exhibits to include Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and other historical documents, arguing that the Ten Commandments were similarly influential in the development of Western legal thought.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose. Michael W. McConnell, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford, calls such displays “triumphalism — a flavor of who is top dog.”\n\nIn a second case, Thomas Van Orden v. Rick Perry, the court allowed carvings of the Ten Commandments in a Texas State Capitol monument that had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a primarily secular group, in 1961. The court cited the donor’s lack of religious intent.\n\nIn his Van Orden opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who cast the swing vote in both cases, called the historical factor alone “determinative”: The monument had stood since 1961 without controversy.\n\nThe Peace Cross, also donated by a secular group, is almost twice as old as the monument in that case, and has been on public property for a comparable span. If the Supreme Court reviews this one, Mr. McConnell believes it will be squarely governed by Justice Breyer’s opinion.\n\n“I think they thought they were putting this kind of case to rest with Van Orden,” said Mr. McConnell, who has also served as a judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. “Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didn’t get the memo.”\n\n“I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuit’s decision quite surprising. If the Supreme Court were to grant review, the likelihood is very high that it would be reversed.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Peace Cross opponents argue that there is a stark difference between the Ten Commandments and a cross — namely, the figures each represents.\n\n“The court pointed out that Moses was a lawmaker as well as a religious leader,” said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the American Humanist Association, who argued the case in the Fourth Circuit. “There were connections to the nation’s history of lawmakers that made the Ten Commandments overall less religious than an enormous, free-standing Latin cross that unequivocally represents Christianity.”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s thinking on displays of the cross is murky.\n\nIn Salazar v. Buono, a 2010 decision regarding a cross-shaped war memorial in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, six justices wrote distinct opinions. In 2011, when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal regarding a series of highway memorial crosses for fallen police officers in Utah, Justice Clarence Thomas’s 19-page dissent argued that the court had rejected “an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles.”\n\nAwaiting its fate, the Peace Cross stands with a tarp draped neatly across the top, where the concrete has begun to crumble. Elizave Mordan, the King Pawn manager, can see it from her shop.\n\n“We heard they may be taking it down, and I disagree with that. It just doesn’t bother anybody around here,” she said as she sorted through used power tools, record players and antique jewelry for sale.\n\n“I worry nobody is going to remember them,” she said of the 49 fallen soldiers. “You can’t remember something you cannot see.”', 'A 40-Foot Cross Has Honored War Dead for 90 Years.

Signers include such well-known culinary celebrities as Jose Andres, Anthony Bourdain, Tom Colicchio, Carla Hall, Padma Lakshmi and Christina Tosi.\n\nThe brief says, in part, that the First Amendment “does not allow a chef, baker, or other culinary artist to refuse to provide a generally offered service based on the identity of the customer.” When a chef offers something to the public, the brief says, “he must offer it to all.” And there is no basis in the law, the brief says, to recognize an exception for wedding cakes.\n\nMike Wiley, winner of the 2017 James Beard Best Chef: Northeast award, said he signed onto the brief when he learned of it from a new employee who had received a copy from friends.

Phillips offered to sell them a pre-made cake, and told them he also does not make Halloween cakes because of his religious convictions.

The fallen-governor\'s new case claims that based on a previous decision, McCormick v. the United States, the fundraising activities were not illegal. That case found that a politician must make an explicit promise to a donor to take an official action in exchange for campaign money to be in violation of the law.Thursday\'s petition to the Supreme Court is the second for Blagojevich. His first was denied by the high court in March of 2016. Blagojevich has apologized for what happened, but has never gone the full distance by admitting the crimes that have landed him behind bars.As governor, the flashy, publicity-eager Blagojevich fancied himself as presidential timber.

Now it is his latest appeal headed to Washington, with his personal freedom on the line.If this latest appeal also fails, or is not considered at all, Blagojevich\'s last real hope would be for President Donald Trump to OK the former governor\'s request for a commutation. Blagojevich had previously asked President Obama for an 11th hour commutation but Mr. Obama left office without granting the request.Mr. Trump, who already shunned Blagojevich on the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" TV show, has given no indication he plans to show Blagojevich mercy this time.It has been five years since the convicted ex-governor reported to the Federal Correctional Institution-Englewood in Littleton, Colo., about 14 miles outside of Denver.

And Rod is alone away from all of us.If my husband were governor of Colorado, Florida, New York, Texas or Nevada, or many other states, these charges would never have been brought or he would have been acquitted because the law is different, and his actions would never have been considered criminal.My sincere hope is that the supreme court will finally right this wrong and bring my husband home to his family where he belongs.\"\"Our petition lays out a compelling case that the Supreme Court needs to settle the confusion among federal courts about the dividing line between campaign fundraising, something all elected officials are required to do (unless they are billionaires) and the federal crimes of extortion and bribery. The prosecutors in this case took advantage of this confusion to obtain one of the most severe sentences ever handed out in a political corruption case to a governor who never sought a bribe or a kickback and never took a penny from his campaign fund for his personal use.The petition also asks the Supreme Court to make clear that sentencing courts must always consider a defendant\'s showing that the sentence proposed by the Government is grossly disproportionate to those handed out to others found guilty of similar, or less egregious, offenses. Here, Blagojevich\'s sentence was more than twice as long as that given any other official convicted of corruption, yet the court of appeals held that the district court was free to simply ignore the defense\'s plea for a more proportionate sentence.I also want to acknowledge the fantastic work of my co-counsel Kevin Russell in Washington DC, and Wells Dixon and Shayana Kadidal in NYC.\"', 'Blagojevich asks for mercy from Supreme Court', -0.3, 7.2),

The United States Supreme Court said in 1992 that states can\'t make out-of-state businesses collect sales tax on online purchases.\n\nThe idea of requiring companies to collect the internet sales tax, even if they don\'t have a brick and mortar space in Mississippi, isn\'t new. The Department of Revenue points to this law passed in 2009.\n\n\n\n\"It imposed the tax on those type of taxpayers who have exploited the market in Mississippi,\" explained Department of Revenue Spokesperson Kathy Waterbury. \"The problem has been enforcement.\"\n\n\n\nThe new regulation defines the law, saying that means companies making $250,000 or more in business in Mississippi. Still, Attorney General Jim Hood knows it will be challenged.\n\n\n\n\"I\'m confident we\'ll get sued. I\'m willing to defend it to the mat,\" noted Hood. \"In fact, I\'d love to see the Supreme Court have to address this issue.\"\n\nHood has filed briefs in other states\' pending cases in hopes of getting the court to change their mind.

The Commissioner has admitted it\'s unconstitutional. The legislature declined to pass an almost identical law this year because it was unconstitutional.

I just wanted to support it.\" Staff photo by Derek Davis Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →\n\nThe “Chefs for Equality” brief was filed Monday, according to the Human Rights Campaign, and is signed by 222 chefs, bakers and restaurateurs from every state. Signers include such well-known culinary celebrities as Jose Andres, Anthony Bourdain, Tom Colicchio, Carla Hall, Padma Lakshmi and Christina Tosi.\n\nThe brief says, in part, that the First Amendment “does not allow a chef, baker, or other culinary artist to refuse to provide a generally offered service based on the identity of the customer.” When a chef offers something to the public, the brief says, “he must offer it to all.” And there is no basis in the law, the brief says, to recognize an exception for wedding cakes.\n\nMike Wiley, winner of the 2017 James Beard Best Chef: Northeast award, said he signed onto the brief when he learned of it from a new employee who had received a copy from friends. Wiley is co-owner of Hugo’s, Eventide Oyster Co. and The Honey Paw. The employee, Katharine Marsh, is the former head chef at The Spotted Pig, a celebrated restaurant in New York City.\n\n“She’s moved to Maine with her wife and is working full time at Hugo’s,” Wiley said.\n\nMarsh signed the brief and asked Wiley if he were interested, Wiley recalled. The chef said he was “surprised and disappointed” to learn that all states were represented in the brief but Maine.\n\n“It was right in line with my politics, and so I thought why not?” he said.\n\nWendy Larson, the chef-owner of Slates Restaurant & Bakery in Hallowell, signed on after Betsy Sweet, a progressive activist who is running for governor, called and asked her if she would. Larson’s bakery makes the occasional wedding cake, but does not specialize in them.\n\n“I don’t believe in discrimination against anybody,” she said. “Human rights is very big to me. I just wanted to support it, and I felt like Hallowell should be represented.”\n\nRobert Brown, innkeeper at the Rockmere Lodge in Ogunquit, is also listed as a signer, but contacted Thursday, he said he had “no idea” how his name got on the document.\n\nThe wedding cake case dates back to 2012, when Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., refused to sell a couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, a personally designed cake for their reception. Phillips offered to sell them a pre-made cake, and told them he also does not make Halloween cakes because of his religious convictions. Phillips claims to be protected by his religious beliefs and the First Amendment; the couple, represented by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, calls it discrimination.\n\nThe ‘Chefs for Equality’ brief was written by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, an international law firm headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 5.\n\nMeredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: MeredithGoad\n\nShare\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

State courts say precedent doesn’t allow them to rule, and federal courts say they won’t take action until the state courts do something.\n\nThe case involves Rose Mary Knick, a woman who lives alone on about 90 acres of Pennsylvania land that has been in her family for nearly half a century.\n\nOfficials in Scott Township, which includes her land, abruptly decided to create a law taking away the private property rights of landowners if anyone even thought there was an old gravesite there.\n\nNo proof was necessary for the law to then require that the landowner provide daily public access for anyone to trespass.\n\nKnick is asking the high court to overturn the law as a violation of her property rights, as protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“Scott Township’s graveyard law forces property owners to allow warrantless searches by government and unbridled trespassing by the public,” said Pacific Legal Foundation Senior Attorney J. David Breemer. “The Supreme Court should take Ms. Knick’s case to make sure the township does not get away with its flagrant abridgement of constitutionally protected rights.”\n\n“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution.

It’s bounded by fences, stone walls and “No Trespassing” signs.\n\n“There is no cemetery mentioned in the chain of title going back hundreds of years,” said the PLF, which has won numerous property rights fights at the Supreme Court already.\n\n“Nevertheless, in 2013, a town enforcement officer entered the property searching for graveyards. Soon after, Ms. Knick was issued a notice of violation claiming her property contained an old burial ground that had not been kept open to the public. She later received a second notice of violation.”\n\nKnick said: “It was unbelievable that the town would trample all over my rights this way, making it open season for trespassing on my land. I am very hopeful that the Supreme Court will take a stand for the Constitution, and for everybody’s property rights, by striking down this outrageous law.”\n\nIsolated grave sites are not uncommon in parts of the country where there is no ban on burials on private ground. And, indeed, sometimes burials date back to before rules and regulations were in place. So the plains of Pennsylvania do, in fact, contain small burial plots for families and such.\n\nHowever, the records simply don’t show any such location on Knick’s land, PLF said.\n\nThe township simply adopted procedures for its “code enforcement” agents to search her land without permission, and while trespassing, they claimed to have found stone evidence of burial plots.\n\nThe lower courts then decided the township had created a “right-of-way” for the public.\n\nThe township issued her citations, but when the arguments began in state court, suddenly withdrew them. The state court then said it couldn’t make a decision until an enforcement action was pending.\n\nWhen Knick then went to federal court, the judge there claimed an adjudication in state court was required first.\n\n“What a mess,” the petition to the high court said. “The Constitution requires a ‘reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation.’ But this is exactly what [precedent] prevents. It creates a chaotic and unworkable system for adjudicating federal takings claims.”\n\n“Pacific Legal Foundation fights for individual liberty, a core component of which is protection from unconstitutional government intrusion on one’s property and privacy,” said PLF President Steven D. Anderson.\n\n“Defending property rights also means insisting that landowners who have suffered constitutional wrongs have direct access to federal court for redress. Securing these protections requires determination and vigilance, and we look forward to vindicating these vital principles.”\n\nThe demand for access to Knick’s land came after an anonymous “citizen inquiry” claimed there was a burial ground there.\n\n“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution.

(KELO.com) -- The South Dakota Retailers Association (SDRA) has filed an amicus brief in ­­­support of the State of South Dakota’s petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit a case that seeks fair sales tax collections.\n\nUnder a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Quill Corp v. North Dakota, out-of-state sellers are not required to collect or remit sales tax on purchases unless they have nexus – a physical presence – in the state in which the purchase is delivered.\n\nIn an attempt to change this precedent, South Dakota lawmakers passed Senate Bill (SB) 106 in 2016, requiring out-of-state retailers to collect and remit tax on purchases shipped to customers in the state. The South Dakota Retailers Association was instrumental in the passage of the law, which has been working its way through the court system since its enactment.\n\nOn October 2nd, Attorney General Marty Jackley filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. SDRA’s brief in support of the State highlights the Association’s history on the issue and why the organization believes the Court should take up the case.\n\n“SDRA has a long history of defending our members from unfair competition,” stated SDRA Board President Gary Cammack. “Our participation in this lawsuit is part of our ongoing commitment to making sure everyone is competing by the same playbook, something we’ve been fighting for since our organization was founded in 1897.”\n\nThe state of South Dakota and municipalities lose an estimated $50 million annually in sales tax revenue due to these untaxed sales. But Cammack noted that the impact of the outdated tax goes far beyond government revenue. He said giving out-of-state companies a tax break encourages customers to spend their cash out of state, which can impact everyone in a community.\n\n“Before a local retailer even opens their doors, they are placed at up to a 6.5% disadvantage because of this tax differential,” he said. “When that retailer loses business, it means they have less money for salaries, less money to give to the local sports teams, and less to contribute to community causes. Everyone loses out.”\n\nCammack said the Association is hopeful the Court will agree it is time to revisit the issue and finally resolve it.', 'SD continues the online tax fight', 0, 2.9),

The political districts were so skewed in the Republican’s favor they won a supermajority in the assembly even after losing the popular vote in 2012. In this case, seemingly countless democratic votes didn’t “count” because they were so packed and cracked into conservative districts their voices were lost completely.\n\nPolitical gerrymandering occurs when a party draws district lines to benefit their own party. This means both Republicans and Democrats can be guilty of it, yet the Supreme Court case sparking conversation right now is Gill v. Whitford, which challenges the 2011 redrawing of Wisconsin’s state legislative map by Republican lawmakers. The districts were manipulated with computer models and voting data to redraw political boundaries.\n\nOur representative system in America has been manipulated into a political tool parties use to shape districts in their favor. Unfortunately, our voting system has become less and less representative of the actual people and more and more shaped to favor party interests. The manipulation was so extreme, the federal district court found, that it violated the “one person, one vote” principle and the democratic voters’ rights to fair representation required by the Constitution’s promises of equal protection. Virtually, Democratic voters’ votes didn’t count.\n\nA look at SCOTUS’s upcoming Wisconsin gerrymandering caseThe United States Supreme Court granted a hearing Monday that will decide if Wisconsin Republicans acted unconstitutionally when drawing their Read…\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has tried to evade cases about gerrymandering, as districting is a power entrusted to the legislative branch, not the judicial branch. However, it is the court’s duty to check clear oversteps of power which is precisely what the Wisconsin Republican legislature is guilty of. The landmark case could greatly change the way the nation’s elections work.\n\nThose who benefit from this, the legislators, have no incentive to fix this problem, which is why it is crucial that the higher court intervenes when such a threat to democracy is rampant. In the three elections since the redistricting, Democrats have never won more than 39 of the 99 seats, even when they won a majority of the votes cast statewide for assembly candidates. With such an advantage, why would the legislators ever want to end the system that makes them immune to being voted out?\n\nGerrymandering should not be a partisan issue, especially because either side can be harmed by it. No matter which way an individual leans, they have a right to be heard in our democracy. Even high-profile Republicans like Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona and Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio stand with Democrats against the threat gerrymandering poses to democracy.\n\nWithin the case, the main legal arguments focus on the Constitutional violation of equal protection and free expression, as voters packed into skewed districts have less of a voice in the political process and are arguably penalized for their party affiliation. Moreover, extreme gerrymandering can undercut the democratic competition, they argue, which weakens public faith in government and lawmakers are not encouraged to make compromises.\n\nThe bipartisan briefs include research that shows that several sets of alternative maps demonstrated that the appellants could have achieved their valid redistricting goals without handicapping either party’s supporters. Based on this, arguments that insist it is impossible to draw fair districts are simply unfounded.\n\nUW political scientists discuss problematic effects of gerrymanderingThe Madison Institute held a lecture Thursday to discuss the implications and effect of gerrymandering in the Whitford v. Gill Read…\n\nThe legislators used a powerful new gerrymandering tool, based on sophisticated computer modeling and the public must be protected from this invasive new technology. One of the key aspects of democracy is electing officials to represent the people. However, those in office secured their seats by stripping Wisconsin voters’ voices.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court’s conservative wing will most likely argue that judges should stay out of redistricting, this is a landmark case that sparks conversation about an important issue. For America’s sake, let’s hope that the Court rules to end gerrymandering in a government that is supposedly by the people and for the people — not for politicians who have no right to be in office.\n\nClaudia Koechell ([email protected]) is a sophomore majoring in history and political science.

A rewrite of Louisiana law earlier this year is expected to bring the matter back into court, both sides agree.\n\nAccording to the advocacy group\'s data, Louisiana district attorneys are trying to block - and in some cases have succeeded in blocking -- about a third of the juvenile murderers in Louisiana who would qualify for a parole hearing after serving 25 years in prison and finishing educational programming.\n\nThe Supreme Court had said juveniles should only be sentenced to life without parole in rare and extreme cases where the minor is considered the \"worst of the worst\" and cannot be rehabilitated. Jill Pasquarella, an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children\'s Rights, said it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in Louisiana would meet the Supreme Court\'s \"worst of the worst\" definition.\n\nPasquarella said the prosecutors\' challenge of so many juvenile lifers\' parole eligibility means Louisiana will be headed back to court, costing the cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands more dollars. Louisiana not only has to pay for a second defense of the state law, it also pays for some of the lawyers who represent juvenile lifers in such cases.\n\nPete Adams, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, doesn\'t dispute that Louisiana is probably headed back to court. He said the Supreme Court will have to add more clarity to the term \"worst of the worst\" in regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n\"Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court will say what\'s acceptable and what\'s not,\" Adams said. \"If the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can\'t get it, we will abide by that.\"\n\nNot all district attorneys are happy that they are being brought into this fight over juvenile lifers, many of whom have been in prison for decades. Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzarro said he would have preferred if the Legislature had not involved prosecutors in the decision about whether the juvenile lifers should have access to parole.\n\nCannizzarro said the Department of Corrections, where the parole board is housed, is in a much better position to determine whether many of these juvenile murderers should be parole eligible or not.\n\n\"We\'re basically guessing on these cases,\" Cannizzaro said in an interview Friday afternoon. \"I think this is an unfair call for the district attorney.\"\n\nCannizzarro\'s office reviewed 64 cases regarding juvenile murderers, more than any other district attorney in the state. He\'s filed motions to potentially block parole eligibility in 32 of those cases. But several of the cases are quite old -- spanning from the early 1970s to 2007, he said. Cannizzarro, who became district attorney in 2008, wasn\'t in office when any of them were tried.\n\n\"We are trying to make the best decision that we can without really seeing this person,\" he said. \"I think it puts an unfair burden on the district attorneys.\"\n\nFour of Cannizzarro\'s 32 objections to juvenile lifers\' parole eligibility may eventually be dropped; they were only filed because Cannizzarro was afraid his office didn\'t have enough information about the offender yet. The other 28 he decided to oppose because of objections from the victims\' families, survivors of the crime or concerns from former prosecutors who tried the cases. He\'s also seeking to block parole for any offender who has had a poor disciplinary record in prison.\n\nCannizzarro said he believes that a juvenile murderer could mature into an adult that no longer poses a threat to society, but he thinks the Department of Corrections is in a better position to know if a person has changed. \"I do recognize, that over the course of time, that a person might change,\" he said.\n\nHe declined to explain why then he was trying to block the parole board, which is housed in the Department of Corrections, from getting opportunity to decide whether a person should be released in at least 28 cases. The parole board also considers victim opposition, law enforcement concern and prison disciplinary records before granting parole.\n\nCannizzarro\'s position is also at odds with what the district attorneys association fought for during the spring legislative session. The DA\'s group lobbied for the right to block juvenile lifers from getting parole access, which is the main reason it was included in the new law.\n\nPrior to the law change that took place this summer, Louisiana had already been told twice in the past five years by the Supreme Court that the way it handles juveniles convicted of murder was not sufficient. Louisiana and other states had to give people who committed murder before they were adults more opportunities to be released, even if they have spent decades in prison.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by a prisoner in Alabama that states had to offer some parole opportunity to people convicted for murders they committed as juveniles. The justices said juvenile murderers, in particular, should be given access to parole because science shows they haven\'t fully matured and are more likely to make poor decisions. In other words, people who commit serious crimes, even murder, as children are more likely to experience personal growth.\n\nLouisiana responded to the ruling by creating access to parole for juvenile lifers only if they were sentenced after 2012, but not for those who were already in prison at the time. That law was challenged by a juvenile lifer already in a Louisiana prison and, in 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that Louisiana has to give juvenile lifers who had already been locked up a shot at parole.\n\nThis led to a complicated rewrite of the Louisiana law governing juvenile lifers in the 2017 legislative session. Juvenile lifers now have a shot at parole starting this month after they\'ve served 25 years and meeting some other requirements, such as earning a high school diploma equivalent. However, the new law allows prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer\'s access to parole through a special court hearing.\n\nDistrict attorneys had between Aug. 1 and Oct. 30 to file notice for those special hearings. The Louisiana Center for Children\'s Rights has determined that prosecutors have filed notice to challenge parole access for a third of these cases, including the 32 that Cannizzarro mentioned in Orleans.\n\nState Sen. Dan Claitor, R-Baton Rouge, said he isn\'t prepared to say whether the new Louisiana law governing juvenile lifers goes far enough until he sees data from an official source showing the impact of prosecutor challenges. But Claitor, who sponsored this year\'s revised juvenile lifer legislation, conceded the numbers didn\'t look great.\n\n\"I would have to agree -- if those numbers are correct -- it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,\" Claitor said. \"I just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.\"\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nJulia O\'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.

Even so, they argued, the appeals court decision “should not be left on the books,” where it could help in legal battles by teens in a similar situation.\n\nThe ACLU has vowed to continue related litigation challenging Trump administration policies that block unaccompanied immigrants from having an abortion while in U.S. custody.\n\n“We will not stop fighting until we have justice for every young woman like Jane,” Cole said.\n\nThe government’s petition to the Supreme Court argued that Doe was allowed to have an abortion based on a misguided ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That ruling should be overturned, they argued, because the government should not be forced to facilitate an abortion for unaccompanied minors in custody after unlawfully entering the United States.\n\nBut in a statement accompanying last week’s ruling, Justice Patricia Millett, who was part of the appeals court majority, said it was “unclear why undocumented status should change everything” in Doe’s case.\n\n“Surely the mere act of entry into the United States without documentation does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her or his own. Nor can the sanction for unlawful entry be forcing a child to have a baby,” Millett wrote.\n\nDoe’s case was closely watched for its potential impact on two contentious issues — access to abortion and immigration policy — and Paxton had greeted news of Doe’s abortion by saying he was profoundly disappointed that the Trump administration allowed the procedure to take place without a Supreme Court challenge.\n\nOn Friday, Paxton said he supported the appeal, saying it was clear that “ACLU lawyers misled the Department of Justice in order to carry out this heinous act against an innocent unborn life.”', 'Trump lawyers seek to reignite legal fight over Jane Doe\'s abortion', -0.5, 14.9),

The shelter did not assist her, citing a new government policy that they offer life-affirming support to women and girls who are pregnant, according to Slate.\n\nAccording to the report, the shelter took “Jane Doe” to a pro-life pregnancy resource center instead. The ACLU said the teen did not change her mind after receiving counseling, and scheduled an abortion; however, the shelter where she is staying refused to transport her to the appointment.\n\nThe ACLU sued on behalf of the teen, and after a series of appeals by the U.S. government and the ACLU, the pro-abortion legal group won in federal appeals court. The teen aborted her unborn baby the next day.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, NARAL and other abortion activists celebrated the news of the unborn baby’s abortion death.\n\nEarlier this year under President Donald Trump’s administration, the Office of Refugee Resettlement issued a new policy requiring that taxpayer-funded shelters for immigrants and refugees offer life-affirming support to women and girls who are pregnant.\n\nOffice Director Scott Lloyd, a Trump nominee, said the shelters may not take “any action that facilitates” an abortion for unaccompanied minors without his direct approval.\n\nLloyd said that “grantees should not be supporting abortion services … only pregnancy services and life-affirming options counseling.”', 'ACLU Lied to Get Illegal Immigrant an Abortion Before Supreme Court Could Rule', -0.4, 17.9),

(Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nAUSTIN — Nine days after an undocumented teenager in Texas had her court-ordered abortion, the U.S. Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to vacate the lower court order allowing her to do so, arguing that her attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union mislead federal officials about the abortion\'s specifics.\n\nAttorneys for the Justice Department submitted a petition to the high court on Friday, arguing that they were unable to file an appeal in time to stop the procedure from happening because the minor’s legal team “kept the government in the dark” about when the abortion was scheduled.\n\nThey argued that the teenager was originally scheduled to visit a clinic to obtain Texas’ mandatory ultrasound and counseling, but the time and nature of her appointment was changed from a 7:30 a.m. counseling to a 4:15 a.m. abortion.\n\n“The ACLU misled the United States as to the timing of Jane Doe\'s abortion,” said Devin O’Malley, spokesman for the Justice Department, in a statement.\n\nMore: Undocumented teenager held by US in Texas has abortion after court battle\n\nDavid Cole, legal director of the ACLU, said they acted within the law.\n\n“Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with the court orders and federal and Texas law,” David Cole, legal director of the ACLU, said in a statement. “That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours.”\n\nThe 17-year-old girl, called Jane Doe in court documents, has been in the custody of the federal government in Texas since she crossed the U.S.-Mexico border at an undisclosed location illegally in September.\n\nWhen she found out she was pregnant, she said she wanted to have an abortion and was brought before a Texas judge, who issued a judicial bypass — a legal order that allows minors to have an abortion without parental consent.\n\nMore: Undocumented teen in federal custody in Texas wins latest legal fight to get abortion\n\nLawyers for the teenager said officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shelter where she was detained did not allow her to leave for the procedure and instead required that she receive counseling from a religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy center.\n\nHer case moved back and forth between a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit until U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan ordered the government to allow the minor to go to a clinic for the procedure as soon as possible.\n\nThe minor had the procedure the following day, Oct. 25, before the federal government could appeal Chutkan’s decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Texas, women must visit an abortion clinic for a sonogram at least 24 hours before a scheduled abortion, and both the initial meeting and the abortion must be performed by the same doctor.\n\nMore: Appeals court temporarily blocks abortion for undocumented teen\n\nAn earlier order from the appeals court blocked the teen from having an abortion but allowed her to go to the clinic for the mandatory counseling.\n\nWhen the district court judge ordered an abortion for the teen, she was taken to the same doctor and had the procedure.\n\n“After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the ACLU’s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn’t delayed any further — not to give the government another chance to stand in her way,” Cole said in a statement. “This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion. Now, because they were unable to stop her, they are raising baseless questions about our conduct.”\n\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to vacate the district judge’s ruling and assess whether attorneys for the teenager should be disciplined.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he supports the federal government\'s decision to take the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"t seems very clear to me that ACLU lawyers misled the Department of Justice in order to carry out this heinous act against an innocent unborn life,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"I hope the Court will hold the responsible ACLU lawyers accountable for their conduct.”\n\nMore: Texas can\'t become \'sanctuary state for abortions,\' Paxton tells court\n\nMadlin Mekelburg is a reporter with the USA Today Austin Bureau; she may be reached at 512-479-6606; mmekelburg@elpasotimes.com; @madlinbmek on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/health/2017/11/03/department-justice-says-aclu-mislead-feds-jane-doe-abortion-case/829342001/', 'Department of Justice says ACLU \'mislead\' feds in Jane Doe abortion case', -0.3, 13.7),

He said many tenants don\'t know what their rights are. He said he had been previously told by Schuchman that tenants would get plenty of time before they faced eviction, and he doubted the city will start evictions soon.\n\n\"I don\'t think they will move quickly because they will face an outcry if they do,\" Grundman said.\n\nHe said that even if the properties are sold, there is no guarantee the city will grant rental licenses to the new owners, because of the condition of the buildings. \"A buyer would face a significant hurdle in getting them fixed,\" he said.\n\nKhan said Monday that his tenants will suffer as a result of the high court decision.\n\n\"To me it is a loss for my tenants,\" he said. \"It is not as much of a loss for me. I can sell [the properties]. There is a housing shortage and there\'s a sellers market.\" The average age of his properties was \"a hundred plus years old,\" he said, and the total value of the properties, which include 11 duplexes, could be in the range of $5 million.\n\nIn a 2015, James Gurovitsch, an administrative hearing officer, endorsed the city decision to revoke the licenses.\n\n\"These requests for services at Mr. Khan\'s properties have led to an inordinate number of site visits by housing inspectors to the properties resulting in an astounding number of written orders,\" he wrote. The number of site visits and re-inspections to these properties has caused a drain on city resources and would not be necessary if the owner was proactive in his management of these properties.\"\n\nKhan said that the 3550 housing violations he received were not so many when one considers he at one point had about 90 properties and the violations occurred over seven or eight years. He said some of the buildings he bought had 100 violations before he repaired and rented them out.\n\nKahn is not the only landlord to face license revocation proceedings by the city. Last month an administrative hearing officer issued an opinion that city regulators could strip about 60 rental licenses from Stephen Frenz, who they contend repeatedly failed to disclose that controversial landlord Spiros Zorbalas continued to have an ownership interest in his properties. The city revoked Zorbalas\' license in 2010.\n\nA city council committee will hear the Frenz case on Nov. 28, then forward its decision to the City Council which will then vote on whether to revoke the licenses.\n\nTwitter: @randyfurst', 'US Supreme Court ends embattled Minneapolis landlord Khan\'s appeals process', -0.1, 9.3),

Because cardholders are empirically more sensitive to credit card fees than merchants, as a practical matter credit card companies charge most of their fees to, and therefore derive most of their revenue from, merchants, usually calculated as a fixed fee per transaction and/or as a variable fee calculated as a percentage of the price of the good or served purchased.', 'Supreme Court to Decide First Antitrust Case in Two Years', 0, 2),

Madison was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer in 1985.\n\nMadison understands he is being executed for a murder, but he doesn’t recall the crime or the trial, according to a psychologist hired by his lawyer. A concurrence by Justice Stephen G. Breyer summarized Madison’s issues.\n\nMadison “has lived nearly half of his life on death row,” Breyer said. “During that time, he has suffered severe strokes, which caused vascular dementia and numerous other significant physical and mental problems. He is legally blind. His speech is slurred. He cannot walk independently. He is incontinent.

Supreme Court precedent has not clearly established that “a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment,” the court said.\n\nThe high court said it was ruling based on the deferential standard given state court determinations established by the AEDPA. “We express no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context,” the Supreme Court said.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred in an opinion joined by Breyer and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She said the issue in the case warrants a “full airing,” but the court is constrained by the AEDPA.\n\nBreyer wrote a separate concurrence. Madison is 67 years old and is “one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,” Breyer said. The average time on death row for the 21 people executed this year was 19 years, he said.\n\nThe trend could bring more cases to the court involving “state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age,” Breyer added. “And we may well have to consider the ways in which lengthy periods of imprisonment between death sentence and execution can deepen the cruelty of the death penalty while at the same time undermining its penological rationale. …\n\n“Rather than develop a constitutional jurisprudence that focuses upon the special circumstances of the aged, however, I believe it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the problem—the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.”\n\nBreyer first called for a review or the constitutionality of the death penalty in a lethal injection case in 2015.\n\nThe case decided Monday is Dunn v.

Both times juries returned verdicts in favor of Apple—the first ordering Samsung to pay more than $1 billion in damages, the second ordering a payment of $120 million.\n\nNews today concerns the second verdict. In 2016, the $120 million verdict was thrown out entirely by a panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals. The judges said that patents on Apple features like smartphone autocorrect and \"slide to unlock\" were invalid in light of prior art.\n\nFurther Reading The jury is in: Samsung infringes, but damages to Apple are a “mere” $120M But it turned out that the judges who were skeptics of Apple\'s smartphone patents were a decided minority on the court. The full Federal Circuit court decided to take up the case \"en banc,\" and when it was reheard, Apple was victorious on an 8-3 vote.\n\nThat got Apple its $120 million verdict back. Samsung asked the US Supreme Court to be the final arbiter on the matter—just as it was for the first litigation. Today, the high court denied (PDF) Samsung\'s petition without comment. That means the Korean company is seemingly at the end of its long legal road and will need to pay out the $120 million.\n\nThe infringed patents in this case include US Patent Nos. 8,046,721 (slide-to-unlock), 8,074,172 (word correction), and 5,946,647 (quick links). The \'647 \"quick links\" patent, which describes a process for turning structures such as addresses and phone numbers into easily clickable links, accounted for nearly $100 million of the damages award.\n\nFurther Reading Apple got its verdict back—$120M against Samsung It\'s a win for Apple, but it\'s far from what the Cupertino company was hoping for. Apple lawyers had sought more than $2 billion in damages at the second trial, making the jury\'s award around 5 percent of what was asked for. The $120 million won\'t make much of a dent in Samsung\'s bottom line. The South Korean conglomerate\'s third-quarter operating profits amounted to $12.91 billion.\n\nAs for that first verdict, it has gone up and down through appeals courts many times, significantly lowering the damages figure in the process. Right now, it\'s getting lined up for another jury trial to reconsider $399 million in damages. The US Supreme Court said that the method used to calculate damages on design patents, the biggest part of the verdict, was improper.\n\nThe first trial accused a wide range of Samsung phones of infringing iPhone patents, including the Galaxy S and Galaxy S II.

Among other issues, he had argued that his original attorneys had \"badgered\" him into the January 2015 plea agreement.\n\nThe effect, if any, on two other people Maggio has implicated in the bribery scheme -- nursing-home owner and campaign financier Michael Morton of Fort Smith and lobbyist and former state Sen. Gilbert Baker, R-Conway -- is unclear.\n\nA legal expert not involved in Maggio\'s case suggested that the ousted judge\'s likelihood of success at this stage is minimal.\n\n\"I think [the Supreme Court\'s] turning down his petition, that\'s really the end of the line,\" said John DiPippa, interim dean of the W.H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.\n\nThe high court did not comment on its decision.\n\nMaggio\'s attorney, John Wesley Hall, said a case that Hall views as similar to Maggio\'s in terms of a key legal issue could still offer hope to Maggio if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the other case.\n\nThe U.S. solicitor general, who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court, is to file a response in the other case by Nov. 24. That case also deals with a quid pro quo issue, Hall said.\n\nDepending on what the solicitor general says in that case, \"a petition for rehearing might be appropriate,\" Hall said in an email interview. \"On the other hand, it could be a death knell for [that case] that [the Maggio] review was denied\" in the Maggio petition.\n\nHall also raised an old issue as a possible avenue of appeal, one that another Maggio attorney had raised at one point but later abandoned: ineffective assistance of counsel -- specifically by Maggio\'s original attorneys, Lauren Hoover and Marjorie Rogers.\n\nMaggio has alleged that Hoover and Rogers \"badgered\" him into pleading guilty.\n\nNeither Hoover nor Rogers returned email or phone messages seeking comment Monday.\n\nHall said a petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective counsel would be due in 10 months. A petition for rehearing would extend that time, he said.\n\nAsked whether Maggio might cooperate again with the federal government in the hopes of getting his prison time reduced, Hall said, \"Unknown since his cooperation wasn\'t all that good to begin with it would seem.\" Hall said, he was sure the U.S. attorney\'s office would want any information Maggio might have.\n\nHall said such a decision is up to Maggio, \"and we haven\'t talked about it in a while,\" since Hall has been busy with another case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Chris Givens declined comment on whether the investigation of the bribery Maggio detailed in his agreement was continuing. Givens confirmed that anyone in prison can cooperate with the federal government and have the U.S. attorney\'s office recommend a lighter sentence. Givens declined comment on whether that would happen in Maggio\'s situation.\n\nAt this point, Maggio is the only one who has been charged with a crime in the bribery case. In his agreement, he said his campaign had indirectly taken thousands of dollars in funds for his final judicial race in exchange for his lowering a Faulkner County jury\'s $5.2 million judgment to $1 million in a nursing home negligence lawsuit.\n\nThe agreement did not identify Baker or Morton by name, but both men have said Maggio was talking about them. They have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe negligence lawsuit resulted from the 2008 death of Martha Bull, 76, of Perryville in Morton\'s Greenbrier nursing home. On July 8, 2013, Morton signed off on thousands of dollars in donations to several political action committees. On July 10, 2013, Maggio slashed the judgment. Morton has said he intended for the PAC donations to go to Maggio\'s campaign for an appeals court seat, and some did.\n\nBaker\'s attorney, Bud Cummins, did not return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMatt DeCample, a spokesman for Morton, said Morton and his attorney had no comment.\n\nDiPippa said that if the Supreme Court had thought Maggio\'s case was \"sufficiently alike\" the other case Hall mentioned, \"they would have taken both of those cases or asked for additional time in both of them.\"\n\n\"Usually what that means is that they [the Supreme Court justices] don\'t think that anything that they do would affect the Maggio case,\" DiPippa added.\n\nOn the likelihood of Maggio\'s resuming cooperation with the government, DiPippa said, \"I think the issue is whether or not he really does have information that can be used in some other prosecution or investigation. I don\'t know [if he does] because I don\'t know how many other people might be caught up in that investigation.\n\n\"From the outside, it doesn\'t look like there\'d be much information that would be helpful\" that the prosecution hasn\'t already acted upon, DiPippa said. \"But again, I don\'t have enough information to know for sure.\"\n\nAnother element is that the U.S. attorney\'s office in Little Rock has changed leadership since Maggio pleaded guilty. Chris Thyer was the U.S. attorney then but recused from the case, leaving his chief deputy, Pat Harris, in charge. Cody Hiland, a former prosecutor in the same judicial circuit where Maggio formerly presided, became the U.S. attorney in October.\n\nMaggio was a judge in the 20th Judicial Circuit, which covers Faulkner, Van Buren and Searcy counties.\n\nThe statute of limitations for prosecuting anyone else in the bribery case also is approaching.\n\nHarris has said that the window would close in 2018. He was not more specific, and Givens later declined comment on that matter.\n\nThe law provides a five-year limit from the time the last crime occurred. Exceptions include a crime that also involves murder. The Maggio case did not involve a homicide. Based solely on Maggio\'s publicly released plea agreement, the five-year limit could be reached in July 2018.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court ordered Maggio removed from the bench in September 2014 because of comments he made online.

The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.\n\nIn a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have \"long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders\' rights at the expense of innovation and competition.\"\n\nApple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing \"novel or important\" to review in its rival\'s appeal.

The battle that has been raging for nearly a decade, however, might be at a close now that the Supreme Court has finally put its foot down. Unfortunately for Samsung, that means it will indeed have to fork over the $119.6 million a jury awarded to Apple years ago. But while the sum is peanuts for Samsung, and only a fraction of what Apple wanted, the loss is nonetheless legal leverage Apple can exploit in the future.\n\nThe patent war between Apple and Samsung has ranged for years and has encompassed gestures and features we take for granted today, like slide to unlock and turning addresses and numbers into tappable links. In 2014, a San Jose, California jury awarded Apple nearly $120 million in damages, having found Samsung guilty of infringement. Apple, however, was seeking $2.2 billion.\n\nNaturally, Samsung preferred not to pay a single cent. And thus began a legal roller coaster, where a Federal Court overturned the verdict, only to have it reinstated by even more judges in 2016. With no other recourse, Samsung turned to the Supreme Court for its last appeal.\n\nUnfortunately for Samsung, the Supreme Court doesn’t want to get dragged into the ongoing drama. It has refused to hear Samsung’s appeal to have the full amount stricken off. That practically means that Samsung will have to pay that sum anyway.\n\nSamsung has had mixed results with its patent squabbles with Apple, winning some and losing others. It is lucky enough to have narrowly escaped paying the full amount that Apple has been seeking, which is quite on par with these kinds of legal proceedings. The dance between the two giants, however, did cause the industry as a whole to take stock of the US patent system and demand for reforms.\n\nSOURCE: Reuters', 'Samsung vs Apple patent appeal rejected by US Supreme Court', 0, 4.6);

Back in May 2014, a San Jose, California federal court ruled that Samsung infringed several Apple patents that allowed for several popular iPhone features, such as slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, and the ability for information like addresses and phone numbers to automatically turn into links.\n\nEditor\'s Pick Samsung mocks iPhones (and iPhone fans) in new ad Back in 2012 Samsung was making deep inroads into Apple territory, stealing market share from the iPhone maker with a combination of compelling products and great marketing.

That verdict was eventually overturned by the Federal Circuit, but it was then reinstated in October 2016 by that same court.\n\nExpectedly, Samsung appealed the decision to the next highest court – the US Supreme Court. In the appeal, Samsung stated that the Federal Circuit, which specifically deals with patents, made the decision without listening or reading the whole story. The company also implied that the patent court is biased toward patent holders.\n\nAlas, today’s decision by the Supreme Court put the kibosh on the company’s appeal. This means that Apple’s $120 million award is back on, much to Samsung’s detriment.\n\nIn a statement sent to Engadget, Samsung is not too happy with the decision:\n\nOur argument was supported by many who believed that the Court should hear the case to reinstate fair standards that promote innovation and prevent abuse of the patent system. One of Apple’s patents at issue in this case has been invalidated by courts around the world, and yet today’s decision allows Apple to unjustly profit from this patent, stunts innovation and places competition in the courtroom rather than the marketplace.\n\nAt first blush, the Supreme Court’s decision effectively puts an end to this case. The good news for Samsung is that this does not change an earlier decision to toss a $399 million verdict against the company, but it does bring the legal drama between Samsung and Apple closer to its end.', 'US Supreme Court will not hear Samsung\'s appeal in patent loss to Apple', 0, 5.8),

In 2016 a Supreme Court decision made the 2012 ruling apply retroactively, yet the state of Louisiana continues to push back and fight against giving juvenile offenders an opportunity at parole.\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that according to the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, prosecutors in the state are trying to block too many juvenile murderers from having a chance at parole—which means the state may not be in compliance with the high court ruling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana district attorneys have tried to block, or have already successfully blocked, about one-third of the juvenile murderers who meet the state’s requirement of having served 25 years and completed educational programming to qualify for parole.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, only juveniles who are considered “the worst of the worst” and incapable of being rehabilitated should be sentenced to life without parole—and those should be rare cases. Based on that, Jill Pasquarella—who is an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights—told Nola.com that it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in the state would meet the Supreme Court’s definition of “worst of the worst.”\n\nBecause prosecutors have challenged the parole eligibility of so many juvenile lifers, Pasquarella said that the state will be headed back to court—which will cost the already cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands of more dollars. In addition to the cost of funding a second defense of the state law, in some cases, the state will have to pay the lawyers that represent the juvenile lifers in these cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete Adams is the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, and he acknowledges that the state is probably headed back to court, but he says the Supreme Court needs to add more clarity to what “worst of the worst” means with regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n“Eventually the U.S. Supreme Court will say what’s acceptable and what’s not,” Adams told Nola.com. “If the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can’t get it, we will abide by that.”\n\nInterestingly enough, when the Supreme Court did make its ruling in 2012, Louisiana answered that by creating a law that only gave access to parole to juvenile lifers who had been sentenced after 2012—not those who were already in prison at that time. A juvenile lifer challenged the Louisiana law, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the state clarification and said it needed to give juvenile lifers who were already locked up a chance at parole as well.\n\nIn response to that, during the 2017 legislative session, the Louisiana law was rewritten so that beginning this month (November), juvenile lifers who have served 25 years and meet other requirements, such as obtaining a high school diploma equivalent, would have a shot at parole. The new law leaves room for prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer’s access to parole through a special hearing.\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, run by Leon Cannizzarro, has reviewed the cases of 64 juveniles serving life for murder—more than any other district attorney in the state. The office has filed motions to block 32 of those cases from parole eligibility.\n\nThose 32 cases count in the number that makes up the one-third of the total cases in the state in which the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights says state prosecutors are seeking to challenge parole access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Dan Claitor (R-Baton Rouge)—who sponsored this year’s revised juvenile lifer legislation—conceded that the state’s numbers don’t look good when it comes to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n“I would have to agree—if those numbers are correct—it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,” Claitor said. “I just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.”\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.', 'Despite Supreme Court Ruling, District Attorneys in La.

The verdict could have led to larger damages against the company for later versions of the game, which reaped billions of dollars in revenues, if jurors had found that those, too, had been lifted from Antonick’s work.\n\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Marc Benioff\'s mountain lion sighting sfgate\n\nSmoke wafting from Meraki Market\'s chimney sfgate\n\nSonoma Shine: Firefighter loses his home, but not his voice sfgate\n\nDe Young museum\'s Minecraft map of Teotihuacan sfgate\n\nUpper mountain at Squaw Valley blanketed in snow sfgate\n\nZaza Pachulia discusses Denver game SFGate\n\nMassive lizard found in California backyard sfgate\n\nMurders in San Francisco sfgate\n\nSan Francisco Deltas coach and players talk about the team\'s first year sfgate\n\nSea otter uses crosswalk in Moss Landing sfgate\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who presided over the trial, overturned the verdict in January 2014, saying jurors never actually compared Antonick’s work or his source codes with the later games and thus lacked evidence of illegal copying.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld Breyer’s ruling last November, and on Monday the nation’s high court denied a hearing on Antonick’s appeal, without comment. Breyer’s brother, Justice Stephen Breyer, did not take part in the court’s review of the case.\n\n“Madden Football,” which first appeared in 1988, was a departure from other computer games that depicted a handful of players making robotic movements. The new game, first conceived in a parking lot conversation between the former NFL coach and the founder of Electronic Arts, showed all 22 players carrying out NFL plays.\n\nAntonick was given credit and royalties for the first edition. But Electronic Arts brought in new programming teams in 1990 and said they started from scratch, without using Antonick’s source code.\n\nAt the trial in 2013, an expert witness for Antonick testified that the 1990-96 games were strikingly similar to Antonick’s original version — they used the same plays and formations, the same system of player ratings, a similar wide field and eight-point directional system, and even a pair of lists that both misspelled the word “scrimmage.”\n\nHowever, jurors were not shown the two games side by side, and did not hear evidence about the source code that Antonick accused Electronic Arts of copying.\n\nWithout the source code, the jury “could not compare the works to determine substantial similarity,” Judge Andrew Hurwitz said in a 3-0 ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that upheld Breyer’s decision to overturn the verdict.\n\nJohn De Stefano, a lawyer for Antonick, said Monday that the programmer and a supporting group of law professors had hoped the Supreme Court would take up the case and overturn the appeals court’s “archaic rule” requiring evidence of a computer code to support a claim of illegal copying.\n\n“A lay jury can’t necessarily decipher a computer code, let alone compare them from different platforms,” and should be allowed to rely on expert testimony, De Stefano said. He said Antonick had turned his source code over to Electronic Arts after working on the original version of the game, and it was no longer available when he saw details of the new versions many years later.\n\nElectronic Arts declined to comment.\n\nThe case is Antonick vs. Electronic Arts, 17-168.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The state, town, and community group filed for a petition for certiorari in August, asking for Supreme Court review after the tribe won permission to open a bingo hall, using electronic machines similar to slots, at its vacant community center.\n\n“Once the petitions are denied, we hope the commonwealth and the town will take the tribe up on its longstanding offers to coordinate efforts between our governments so that the entire community will benefit from the tribe’s economic development activities,” Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, the tribe’s chairwoman, wrote in a prepared statement.\n\nAt issue is whether a 1987 land settlement reached between the town, the state, and the tribe remains binding after Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988. The tribe contends that IGRA supersedes the settlement act, which the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld.\n\nIn the agreement, the tribe agreed to “be subject to the civil and criminal laws, ordinances, and jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the town of Gay Head, Massachusetts (including those laws and regulations which prohibit or regulate the conduct of bingo or any other game of chance).”\n\nIn its 40-page court filing, the tribe’s attorneys contend that the language only relates to the short window of time between when the settlement act was codified by Congress and when IGRA was enacted.\n\nThe state and town, which won at the district court level, contend that the settlement act is binding, and that the tribe knew it was waiving its rights to offer gambling on the Island of Martha’s Vineyard. In its brief before the nation’s highest court, the state and town contend that the First Circuit decision is in conflict with another appeals court ruling in the Fifth Circuit that went against a Texas tribe.\n\nIGRA was approved by Congress to resolve questions over tribe rights, the tribe’s brief argues. If Congress wanted to make IGRA not applicable for the Aquinnah Wampanoag, it could have done that, the tribe’s brief argues.\n\n“If any doubt remains, it should be resolved not by looking to legislative history, but on the ground that ‘statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit,’” the tribe’s brief states.\n\nThe state and town case for review also argues that the appeals court decision is in opposition to the Supreme Court with regard to “implied repeals.” In the case where two laws approved by Congress clash, the courts usually side with the more specific of the two, in this case the settlement act, according to the briefs filed in support of Supreme Court review.\n\nThe tribe’s brief contradicts that. “The rule that a later-enacted statute prevails over an earlier conflicting one dictates that IGRA displaces the Settlement Act with regard to gaming. The later-enactment rule is sometimes called the ‘implied repeal’ doctrine: When two federal statutes ‘are in irreconcilable conflict,’ this Court has said, ‘the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one,’” the tribe’s brief states.\n\nIn its petition, the town and community association pointed to an April 1986 hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, where Gladys Widdis, the tribal council chairwoman at the time, testified about the importance of the tribe’s settlement agreement for the development of the tribe economically and socially.\n\n“Mr. Chairman, we recognize and accept that this bill will not empower our tribe to conduct high-stakes gaming on the public or private settlement lands provided in this bill,” Ms. Widdis is quoted as saying. She also provided a written statement, according to the petition. “We recognize and accept that no gaming on our lands is now or will in the future be possible,” she wrote.\n\nThe tribe responds to that by saying Ms. Widdis was referring to an earlier draft of the settlement act, which provided more jurisdiction to the state and town. “Moreover, IGRA had not passed at this point, so the leader’s statements say nothing about her understanding of the gaming landscape after that statute became law,” according to the tribe’s court filing.\n\nAs for arguments that the tribe’s proposed casino will hurt the town or the state’s fledgling casino industry, the tribe’s brief says that’s not true. “Contrary to petitioners’ assertions, the Tribe’s proposed bingo facility would have few, if any, negative consequences for the Commonwealth or the Town, while having many positive impacts for the Tribe,” the brief states.\n\nThe tribe has indicated previously it can make $4.5 million from the Island facility it has planned, a small fraction of the hundreds of millions that would be generated from the Wynn casino under construction in Everett or the MGM casino in Springfield.\n\n“As for its stake in this case, the Town fails to specify how the Tribe’s modest bingo facility will ‘adversely affect’ the local community, or how it will ‘burden’ local government,” the brief states. “A bingo facility on the Tribe’s settlement lands would be tucked away in the remote western corner of the Island, far from the populous towns on the island’s east side. The facility, under the Tribe’s 2015 proposal, would match the architecture that already exists on the island.”\n\nIt remains a long shot that the Supreme Court will take up the Aquinnah Wampanoag case.

More than 20 former judges, prosecutors and legal experts want the U.S. Supreme Court to agree.\n\nArizona attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether state statutes give too much discretion to prosecutors to determine which murders deserve to be punished by a death penalty, and whether the inability of certain counties to fund capital trials violates the due process clause of the Constitution. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\n\nWe’ve been tinkering with the death penalty for 40 years, but haven’t been able to remove mistakes and unfairness from the system.\n\nAs president of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, I joined with more than 20 former Arizona judges, former prosecutors and legal experts to urge the U.S. Supreme Court to accept a challenge to Arizona’s death penalty statute and end capital punishment in our state and nationwide.\n\nFormer Judge Rudy Gerber, who co-authored Arizona’s death penalty statute, has joined in our challenge to the statute, agreeing that it is now unconstitutional. Why?\n\nMost cases can\'t be \'worst of the worst\'\n\nThe court has held that the death penalty is only constitutional if it is reserved for the “worst of the worst.” To comply with this narrowing requirement, prosecutors must prove there is at least one aggravating factor before the death penalty can be imposed.\n\nGerber, to help comply with this requirement, co-drafted the statute with six aggravating factors, any one of which qualifies a defendant for the death penalty. Over time, the Arizona Legislature has piled on more. Today, prosecutors have 14 aggravating circumstances to allege.\n\nThere are now so many aggravating factors that Arizona prosecutors can seek the death penalty in 99 percent of first-degree murder cases. Ninety-nine percent of cases cannot all be “the worst.”\n\nThe Legislature has failed its constitutional duty to narrow the death penalty to the most deserving offenders. The prosecuting agency has the right to decide in which cases it will pursue the death penalty, and the exercise of that discretion varies throughout the state, from zero in some counties to among the highest in the country in others.\n\nMaricopa County leads the nation in death penalty sentences, with a far greater number of cases prosecuted as capital crimes. The Sixth Amendment guarantees that these defendants have the right to counsel and these attorneys must be specially trained and qualified.\n\n31 states have nixed the death penalty\n\nOne consequence is that the county, on multiple occasions, has run out of defense attorneys who are qualified to handle capital cases. As a result, capital cases often wait — sometimes for years — for justice for all parties involved.\n\nThere currently are a staggering 56 death penalty cases pending in Maricopa County’s Superior Court. Capital murder cases cost eight to 40 times more than first-degree murder cases where the death penalty isn’t being sought.\n\nIncreased costs include not only attorneys but court administration, housing, jury compensation and delays to other cases. And because some counties have the money to prosecute death penalty cases and some don’t, where the crime occurred can become more important than the facts of the case.\n\nAs a nation, we have moved away from capital punishment. Thirty-one states have stopped using the death penalty. Nineteen have formally abandoned it, four have instituted moratoria, and eight have not had an execution in the past decade.\n\nOther states keep the public safe through sentences of life without parole. Arizona, which has already abolished parole for adults, can do the same.\n\nThe court should accept review of Hidalgo vs. Arizona and hold capital punishment unconstitutional in our state and everywhere else.\n\nRegardless, the State of Arizona should take a hard look at why we are spending so much money to continue to engage in this failed experiment. It is time to admit that the system is broken beyond repair.\n\nAmy Kalman is a defense attorney in Maricopa County with experience in capital litigation, and is the president of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice.

It says it’s not subject to jurisdiction in Missouri, noting only seven of the plaintiffs are from Missouri, while 85 of them have no connection to the state.\n\nIt also contends all the claims are preempted by federal law, meaning the company is immune from the lawsuits because a federal agency approved the devise. Bayer also moved to sever claims by individual non-Missouri plaintiffs and transfer those cases to appropriate venues.\n\nIn December of last year, the circuit court rejected Bayer’s motions. The company will argue for the high bench to overturn the lower court’s decision.\n\nMore than 3,700 women have filed lawsuits against Bayer in the U.S., alleging harm from the device. In its annual statement, the company noted it incurred impairment losses of $413 million in connection with Essure.\n\nIn September, Bayer announced it would end non-US sales of the device, but said its decision was not linked to any problem of safety or quality of the product. Company spokesperson Jennifer Brendel told Modern Healthcare in January that the company has sold 750,000 Essure units around the world, the majority of them in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Essure for the marketplace in 2002, but according to the site Drugwatch, has received more than 5,000 adverse event reports about the device since then.\n\nThe device consists of two metal coils implanted in the fallopian tubes that induce scarring to block the tubes and prevent fertilization.\n\nBayer’s claim that the lawsuit is not subject to jurisdiction in Missouri because most of the plaintiffs are from out of state is consistent with legislation Republicans introduced in the state legislature this year.\n\nBills in the House and Senate were, among other things, intended to reduce the number of cases filed in Missouri courts by plaintiffs with no connection to the state.\n\nThe measures were part of an overall focus by the GOP super majority to improve the state’s business climate by doing away with what it called “frivolous lawsuits”. They failed to advance through the General Assembly while other measures designed to limit liability lawsuits did become law.\n\nFor its part, Bayer claims three court decisions this year – two in the U.S. Supreme Court and one in the Missouri Supreme Court – back its contention that there’s no in state jurisdiction for the claims of the 85 non-Missouri plaintiffs.\n\nThe state high bench, in a case known as Norfolk Southern Railway Company versus Dolan, held Norfolk’s significant business in the state was insufficient to establish general personal jurisdiction over Norfolk.\n\nThe decision was seen as an instance in which Missouri Supreme Court continued the U.S. Supreme Court’s trend toward limiting jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant.', 'Missouri high bench will hear case over St. Louis court\'s decision allowing suit against Bayer', -0.4, 11),

As it turns out, it was a futile attempt by Samsung and now, has no option to pay to Apple.\n\nThis is just one of many lawsuits that Samsung and Apple are fighting in lower courts across the US -- the prominent one being the iPhone design patent infringement. The former is accused of stealing iPhone\'s rounded edges, flat screen and shape of apps on the mobile touch screen. The lower court had found Samsung guilty and asked to $339 million fine.\n\nIn December 2016, the US Supreme Court had stayed the order as Samsung found the $339 million fine unfairly high.

The verdict could have led to larger damages against the company for later versions of the game, which reaped billions of dollars in revenues, if jurors had found that those, too, had been lifted from Antonick’s work.\n\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Marc Benioff\'s mountain lion sighting sfgate\n\nSmoke wafting from Meraki Market\'s chimney sfgate\n\nSonoma Shine: Firefighter loses his home, but not his voice sfgate\n\nDe Young museum\'s Minecraft map of Teotihuacan sfgate\n\nUpper mountain at Squaw Valley blanketed in snow sfgate\n\nZaza Pachulia discusses Denver game SFGate\n\nMassive lizard found in California backyard sfgate\n\nMurders in San Francisco sfgate\n\nSan Francisco Deltas coach and players talk about the team\'s first year sfgate\n\nSea otter uses crosswalk in Moss Landing sfgate\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who presided over the trial, overturned the verdict in January 2014, saying jurors never actually compared Antonick’s work or his source codes with the later games and thus lacked evidence of illegal copying.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld Breyer’s ruling last November, and on Monday the nation’s high court denied a hearing on Antonick’s appeal, without comment. Breyer’s brother, Justice Stephen Breyer, did not take part in the court’s review of the case.\n\n“Madden Football,” which first appeared in 1988, was a departure from other computer games that depicted a handful of players making robotic movements. The new game, first conceived in a parking lot conversation between the former NFL coach and the founder of Electronic Arts, showed all 22 players carrying out NFL plays.\n\nAntonick was given credit and royalties for the first edition. But Electronic Arts brought in new programming teams in 1990 and said they started from scratch, without using Antonick’s source code.\n\nAt the trial in 2013, an expert witness for Antonick testified that the 1990-96 games were strikingly similar to Antonick’s original version — they used the same plays and formations, the same system of player ratings, a similar wide field and eight-point directional system, and even a pair of lists that both misspelled the word “scrimmage.”\n\nHowever, jurors were not shown the two games side by side, and did not hear evidence about the source code that Antonick accused Electronic Arts of copying.\n\nWithout the source code, the jury “could not compare the works to determine substantial similarity,” Judge Andrew Hurwitz said in a 3-0 ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that upheld Breyer’s decision to overturn the verdict.\n\nJohn De Stefano, a lawyer for Antonick, said Monday that the programmer and a supporting group of law professors had hoped the Supreme Court would take up the case and overturn the appeals court’s “archaic rule” requiring evidence of a computer code to support a claim of illegal copying.\n\n“A lay jury can’t necessarily decipher a computer code, let alone compare them from different platforms,” and should be allowed to rely on expert testimony, De Stefano said. He said Antonick had turned his source code over to Electronic Arts after working on the original version of the game, and it was no longer available when he saw details of the new versions many years later.\n\nElectronic Arts declined to comment.\n\nThe case is Antonick vs. Electronic Arts, 17-168.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

(Photo: Family photo)\n\nWilliam and Margaret Murr bought two adjacent lots in the early 1960s, built a cabin on one and left the other vacant as an investment. But when their children went to sell the empty lot to finance improvements to the cabin, it was considered substandard under development regulations from the 1970s.\n\nThe family argued that amounted to an uncompensated taking of the land. Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit law firm, got the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, but the court ruled 5-3 for the state in June.\n\nRep. Adam Jarchow (R-Balsam Lake) and Sen. Tom Tiffany (R-Hazelhurst) responded with a bill that would let property owners build on and sell substandard lots if they were legal when they were created. It would also prohibit merging adjacent lots that share the same owner without the owner’s permission.\n\nOther parts of the bill would make it easier to get conditional use permits and variances, maintain non-conforming structures, dredge private ponds, appeal assessments when a homeowner refuses to let the assessor inside the house, and hang the American flag when condominium or homeowner association rules might prohibit that.\n\nDonna Murr, who became the spokeswoman for her siblings during the court fights, said they are not sure yet whether they\'ll sell, develop or keep the extra lot for now.\n\n\"My brothers and sister and I will take a deep breath and make a decision that is best for our family,\" Murr said. \"From the beginning, that has always been what it\'s been about for us.\n\n\"I am a bit overwhelmed but also very happy with today’s votes.

Patchak said the casino, which is about a 3-mile (4.8-kilometer) drive away, would increase traffic and pollution and change the character of the area. And he argued that the federal government had improperly set aside the land for use by the tribe.\n\nA federal court initially dismissed his lawsuit, but an appeals court revived it, and in 2012, more than a year after the casino opened, the Supreme Court ruled that Patchak could proceed with his case.\n\nCongress had other ideas. In 2014, it passed a law shutting down any further litigation over the casino. As a result, Patchak\'s lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nPatchak\'s lawyer Scott E. Gant told the justices Tuesday in oral arguments that Congress went too far when it passed the law, violating the separation-of-powers principle in the Constitution. Gant told the justices that Congress was improperly directing the result in Patchak\'s case.\n\nBut Justice Elena Kagan told Gant that the Supreme Court has said \"over and over again\" that Congress \"can take away the jurisdiction of the federal courts and can do so in a way that affects pending cases.\" Other justices, including Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, suggested that they believe Congress was acting properly.\n\nIf Patchak does win at the Supreme Court and is again allowed to proceed with his lawsuit, he faces a difficult fight against the casino, which is one of 26 in Michigan.\n\nThe casino has over 2,000 slot machines and 50 tables for games including craps, roulette and blackjack. A five-story parking lot is also being constructed, said tribe spokesman James Nye.

Murphy Oil USA.\n\nThis is actually a trio of cases that deal with the NLRB\'s interpretation of arbitration agreements between employers and employees. The NLRB takes the position that arbitration agreements are not permitted under federal labor law if they contain a class action waiver. Employees often wish to bring forward collective disputes in an arbitration setting. Yet, employers generally desire to have each individual dispute handled separately. Federal courts of appeals are divided on the issue.\n\nIn a rare move, the Department of Justice actually reversed its own position on the issue earlier this year. The DOJ had previously sided with the NLRB in favor of the workers\' position. Then in June, the administration indicated that it had \"reconsidered the issue\" and now supports employers\' ability to prohibit class action employment disputes in arbitration agreements.\n\nThe Supreme Court will also decide a dispute involving the Fair Labor Standards Act and auto dealership workers. The question in Encino Motorcars LLC v. Navarro is whether \"service advisers\" who talk to customers about repair work, but do not actually perform the repair work themselves, are exempt from overtime. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California ruled that Congress did not intend to prohibit service advisors from collecting overtime.\n\nThe outcome at the Supreme Court is bound to have a great impact on how the country\'s 18,000 auto dealerships conduct business. Perhaps more importantly, the ruling will probably extend well beyond auto dealerships to any number of other industries that employ people in service advisor roles. Employers should watch this case carefully.\n\nThe third potential landmark case before the court this term is Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In September, the court agreed to revisit the constitutionality of \"fair share fees\" being imposed upon certain public employees as a condition of employment.\n\nMany Supreme Court observers predicted that mandatory fair share fees to unions would be abolished with the early 2016 decision in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. That decision challenged fair share fees head-on based on First Amendment grounds. The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia a month before the Friedrichs decision was released resulted in a 4-4 deadlock. Therefore, the lower court decision to allow fair share fees was permitted to stand.\n\nIt is highly likely that Justice Neil Gorsuch is poised to be the fifth vote necessary to strike down a 40-year-old precedent, thereby abolishing mandatory fair share fee payments. The decision in Janus is likely to affect millions of public workers in 22 states, including Ohio, which do not have right to work laws. It has been estimated that as many as 30% of public sector union members will cease paying dues if the requirement is abolished. Consequently, an abolishment of fair share fee payments will ultimately weaken unions\' ability to conduct business.\n\nLabor unions are keenly aware of this dynamic.

Zinke, the Supreme Court is looking to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute that blocks an American from pursuing a pending lawsuit.\n\nThe federal government turned land in Michigan over to the Gun Lake Tribe, which then opened a casino. David Patchak, who lives near the casino, claimed that the building and operation of the casino caused him injury.\n\nPatchak sued the U.S. government. His case previously arrived at the Supreme Court over whether he had standing to sue. After the justices decided Patchak did have standing, former President Barack Obama signed a law that said any legal action regarding the property at issue in Patchak’s case “shall not be filed or maintained in a federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.”\n\nScott Gant, Patchak’s attorney, argued on Tuesday that the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act signed by Obama was “precisely the kind of legislation the Framers rejected when they designed the Constitution.”\n\nGant said Congress can try to affect the outcomes of cases, but how it does so matters.\n\nAnn O’Connell, representing Trump administration Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke, countered that she did not see any separation of powers problems with any law that targets a single case such as Patchak.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed O’Connell on whether the government recognizes any limitations on Congress’ ability to direct the outcome of a given case. O’Connell said a statute suggesting one side “wins” would be unlawful. O’Connell suggested that the justices could look to resolve Patchak by searching for any difference between the statute’s meaning and an explicit direction on how the case should be decided.\n\nPratik Shah, an attorney for the Gun Lake Tribe, similarly argued that there should be no problem with separation of powers with Congress looking to effectively decide the outcomes of various cases.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan suggested a hypothetical example involving whether Congress could constitutionally create a law that wipes out a slate of employment discrimination lawsuits against a large corporation at the company\'s behest. Shah responded that such an action may be unconstitutional, but not for separations of powers reasons, instead because various rules prevent Congress from singling out an individual litigant.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy responded to Shah’s answer by saying that view could “severely compromise the integrity of the courts.” Gant, Patchak’s attorney, began his rebuttal to the government and Gun Lake Tribe attorneys by highlighting his agreement with Kennedy and raising the possibility that his opponents\' thinking could set a dangerous precedent.\n\n“You will have judges looking over their shoulder wondering if they’re going to be next,” Gant said, suggesting judges would resolve cases while thinking about how Congress might choose to tailor the judges’ rulings.\n\nGiving Congress greater authority to affect the outcomes of various legal cases could raise new questions about how the executive branch will exercise its authority in the Trump era. President Trump said earlier this week that the “saddest thing” was, “Because I’m president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. ... I’m not supposed to be doing the kinds of things I would love to be doing and I’m very frustrated by it.”', 'Supreme Court questions if Congress can affect federal courts\' decisions', -0.2, 7.8),

Respondent Michael Cuero was charged with a misdemeanor and two felonies, one of which was deemed a \"strike\" under California\'s \"three-strike\" law. Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felonies, which yielded a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison, a $10,000 fine and four years on parole. After accepting the plea deal and before sentencing, the state became aware of Cuero\'s previous four imprisonments, two of which were also \"strikes\" under California law and would raise Cuero\'s sentencing minimum to 25 years imprisonment.\n\nThe trial court permitted the state to amend its complaint and Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea under California law, which permits the state to amend the pending complaint when prior felony charges are not included in the guilty plea. The trial court distinguished this amendment from one which adds new charges, finding it did not \"fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.\" Cuero was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nCuero filed a federal habeas petition, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [official website] reversed the trial court\'s decision, finding that specific performance of the original plea deal was \"necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.\" Specifically, the court found \"specific performance\" was of the original plea bargain was the proper remedy in this case where previous court decisions treated withdraw of an agreed-upon plea bargain as a breach of contract.\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court considered whether the trial court\'s decision \"involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,\" as required under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 [text] to uphold the Ninth Circuit\'s reversal.

Specifically, \"the trustee attempted to avoid a payment by the bankrupt company, Valley View Downs\"—a horse race track company—\"to Merit Management, in exchange for Merit Management\'s shares in Bedford Downs,\" a competing race track company.

Despite the Seventh Circuit\'s holding in this case, other Federal courts support Merit\'s view; specifically, \"the Second Circuit is very concerned about the effect that this would have on the leveraged buyout industry and -- and, therefore, the economy more broadly.\"\n\nThe question presented before the Supreme Court is whether Section 546(e) concerns avoidable transfers or party liability and whether this transfer was fraudulent and voidable to FTI, where Merit and the intervening banks were conduits and not direct transferees in the transaction. Merit Manager, the petitioner, \"argues that Section 546(e) protects the payment because it came into Merit’s hands from a financial intermediary,\" but FTI, on the other hand, alleges 546(e) protects the types of financial intermediaries and a transfer six bankruptcy trustees\' interests in avoiding fraudulent transfers that deprive the first owed creditors of money owed.\n\nEvident throughout the argument is the court\'s hesitation to adopt Merit Management\'s interpretation because such a ruling could drastically broaden the scope of transactions unavoidable to bankruptcy creditors.

(Photo: Family photo)\n\nWilliam and Margaret Murr bought two adjacent lots in the early 1960s, built a cabin on one and left the other vacant as an investment. But when their children went to sell the empty lot to finance improvements to the cabin, it was considered substandard under development regulations from the 1970s.\n\nThe family argued that amounted to an uncompensated taking of the land.

A recent example occurred on Oct. 30 when the nation’s highest court effectively endorsed the concept of mandatory inclusionary zoning.\n\nThe story began when a couple applied to the City of West Hollywood to develop 11 condominiums. The city approved the request subject to its policy of requiring developers either\n\nmake some units affordable or\n\npay a fee in lieu of doing so.\n\nIn this case the latter was $540,000, which the developer paid under protest before filing a lawsuit in California state court.

Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that it was a violation of the Constitution to enforce mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders. In the 2016 case Montgomery v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court went even further, ruling that state courts must resentence juvenile offenders, granting these offenders the possibility of parole and freedom.\n\nSince the Montgomery ruling, states have been struggling as they contemplate how to resentence juvenile offenders.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the young people affected?\n\nYouth Radio’s Sierra Fang-Horvath spoke with Marsha Levick, Deputy Director and Chief Counsel at Philadelphia’s Juvenile Law Center and co-counsel to the Montgomery v. Alabama case.The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nSierra Fang-Horvath, Youth Radio: The Montgomery ruling made it possible for inmates sentenced as juveniles to retroactively challenge life without parole rulings. But does that mean states have to automatically undertake the resentencing? Or do inmates have to actively pursue that option themselves?\n\nMarsha Levick: Even if technically the inmate has to pursue the option, I think it’s fair to assume that in the states that are specifically required under both Miller v. Alabama and Montgomery v. Louisiana to resentence the roughly 2,000 individuals around the country who are serving mandatory life without parole sentences, they’re all going to get resentenced.\n\nSFH: Is anything impeding that process?\n\nML: It is a slow process and unfortunately there are a number of factors that have actually contributed to that. Because it wasn’t until 2016 that the Supreme Court required that the Miller decision be applied retroactively, that meant that some of the largest states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Louisiana that house probably about 60 percent of all of the juvenile lifers in the country were essentially four years behind many of the other states that began implementing Miller.\n\nSFH: Do all inmates up for resentencing have the right to be represented by a lawyer?\n\nML: It’s not so much about whether or not they have a right to counsel. It has been challenging, in a number of states, to make sure that everyone has a lawyer to represent them. But once they are actually scheduled for a resentencing hearing, they do have a right to counsel.\n\nSFH: In Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that a juvenile offender must be “permanently incorrigible,” or completely incapable of change, to be sentenced to life without parole. That’s a pretty severe accusation. How would a prosecutor prove that?\n\nML: Actually determining that someone is permanently incorrigible is an extremely high bar. As I think the U.S. Supreme Court said in Miller and in Montgomery, it’s going to be the very rare and uncommon situation where the prosecutor can actually prove that.\n\nSFH: When you, as an appellate attorney, are arguing that your defendant has changed since committing a crime, what do judges want to see?\n\nML: The challenge that we face… is that different judges will view that question and that answer differently. We know that there are still many judges across the country who really are very focused on the crime itself…. But judges need to be able to see beyond that as they’re really instructed to do so by the U.S. Supreme Court, and look at who this individual is. The question that the Supreme Court is requiring [judges] to answer — this notion of who’s permanently incorrigible… that’s separate and apart from the crime that they committed.\n\nSFH: Do you think some states and counties aren’t taking the Montgomery ruling — which says that only permanently incorrigible individuals can be resentenced to life without parole — seriously enough?\n\nML: Yes very much so, I do…. Just look at the language that the U.S. Supreme Court used in both Miller and Montgomery. The Court said that a decision of life without parole for a juvenile offender, even convicted of homicide, should be “rare and uncommon”… If you have a prosecutor in a particular county in Michigan who is seeking life without parole again in all or 90 percent of the cases in that county, it can’t be that 90 percent of those individuals are the rare and uncommon juvenile. That’s not a logical determination…. I hate to use the phrase “we’ll see them in court,” but… if life without parole ends up being re-imposed in a substantial percentage of cases, then I think that’s open to legal challenges. That would certainly seem to be contrary to this idea of a rare and uncommon sentence.\n\nSFH: When someone commits a very serious crime like murder, even if they are under 18, isn’t life without parole a suitable punishment for that sort of crime?\n\nML: I would say no for a couple of reasons. When the U.S. Supreme Court banned the death penalty in 2005 for juveniles who committed murder, [it] said that kids who were under 18 were less culpable and blameworthy for their crimes. That was based on the psychological attributes that the court identified at that time based on research [about]… the susceptibility to negative peer influences, and this capacity, of course, for change and growth and rehabilitation. But importantly, the Court said the death penalty has to be reserved for the worst of the worst, and juvenile offenders are categorically not that person because of their status as adolescents…. We have to ask ourselves, “Are they the worst of the worst?” And in most of the cases, again but for the rare and uncommon juvenile, they’re simply not. It doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be held accountable. It’s not about excusing. It’s about mitigating responsibility and figuring out a way to punish, to hold these individuals accountable, but in ways that also reflect their developmental status.\n\nSFH: Have you ever met someone who was “permanently incorrigible”?\n\nML: I haven’t, no. I think a lot of researchers would say that it’s difficult to paint a picture of who that individual would be, particularly individuals under the age of 18. I think that there may well be experts who would talk about someone who has a mental health diagnosis of psychopathy who might fit that profile. But few experts would diagnose psychopathy in someone under the age of 18 because it’s an extreme and very challenging diagnosis to make. So no, I haven’t. And I don’t know I ever will.\n\nSFH: What future issues do you foresee for the implementation of Miller and Montgomery?\n\nML: What I often say to colleagues is that in this work, every time you think you’ve solved a problem, another one pops up and that’s what’s going to happen here. Even if all… 2000 adults serving juvenile life without parole sentences, are resentenced within the next three to five years, many of them will be resentenced to very long terms: 50 to life, 60 to life, 70 to life, even 40 to life…. Is that effectively also a life without parole sentence? The average life expectancy for many of these individuals is actually kind of in their mid 50s…. So it’s less about will it actually get implemented as it is, to me, about the next series of legal issues that we’re going to be litigating as we see Miller and Montgomery being implemented.\n\nSFH: How do victims and their families feel about these resentencing mandates handed down by the Supreme Court?\n\nML: Victims don’t all have the same view about the perpetrators and their crimes. And there are many… cases where the victim’s family members have stepped forward and supported release, have supported the opportunity for a second chance. They may have had the opportunity to meet with them… [or] to observe their growth, to hear their remorse and their sorrow that they have experienced for what they did. And there are also victims’ family members who will never forgive, for whom the notion that the person who killed their loved ones should ever get out of prison is really an unacceptable scenario…. At the end of the day, the law has set limits for judges engaged in resentencing, even in the face of the most painful, really sorrowful testimony…. At the end of the sentencing hearing, the judge has to set that aside to some degree to enforce the law that the Supreme Court set down in Miller and Montgomery.', 'A Second Chance For Juvenile Offenders?', 0, 24.7),

And if the justices step on it, they could blow up administrative law as it’s currently practiced.\n\nDigital Realty v. Somers presents the question of whether Dodd-Frank’s generous whistleblower protections cover employees who report their concerns internally rather than to the government. In the section of the statute that establishes the Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower bounty program, the law defines whistleblowers as those to report fraud to the government. The anti-retaliation provisions do not explicitly define the term. The SEC, after a notice-and-comment rulemaking process, interpreted the statute to give whistleblowers a right to sue under Dodd-Frank even if they’ve reported internally.\n\nA critical consideration for the justices, as you can probably guess from my description of the case, will be how much deference to give the SEC’s interpretation. Lawyers for the whistleblower suing Digital Realty – Paul Somers, an ex-employee of the real estate investment trust who claims he was fired after reporting alleged securities violations to his bosses – told the Supreme Court in their brief that this is a simple case: Under precedent from 1984’s Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, the court must defer to the SEC’s interpretation of Dodd-Frank.\n\nChevron, as you know, requires courts to defer to executive branch interpretations of the laws Congress has empowered them to enforce, as long as the statutes are ambiguous and the agency interpretation is reasonable. “This is a Chevron case,” wrote Somers’ lawyers at Stris & Maher. “The question is not simply a matter of construing the statute; Congress specifically tasked the SEC with enforcing these provisions, and the SEC has construed Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision in a manner that advances Congress’s objectives.”\n\nThe SEC and the Justice Department, which filed an amicus brief backing Somers (2017 WL 4676666), primarily argued that the justices should not import a cramped definition of a whistleblower from one section of Dodd-Frank to contradict the word’s well-understood meaning in a different section of the law. Alternatively, the government said, the Supreme Court should defer under Chevron to the SEC’s definition of a Dodd-Frank whistleblower because the SEC provided a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\n\nIn Thursday’s reply, Digital Realty’s lawyers at Williams & Connolly mounted a two-stage attack on those Chevron deference arguments. First, they said, Dodd-Frank is not ambiguous: The statute provides a clear definition of a whistleblower – and that definition is limited to people who report allegations to the SEC. “The plain text compels the conclusion that the anti-retaliation provision applies only to a ‘whistleblower,’ as the statute defines the term,” the brief said. “Where, as here, Congress has ‘directly spoken to the precise question at issue,’ the court should not proceed past the first step of the Chevron inquiry.”\n\nAnd even if the justices deem the statute to be unclear, Digital Realty said, they should not defer to an interpretation that was the product of a flawed rulemaking process. The SEC’s final rule on the scope of Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provisions was at odds with the agency’s proposed rule, Digital Realty argued, so commenters didn’t have fair notice. The brief cited last year’s Supreme Court decision in Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, which held that “procedurally defective” agency regulations are not entitled to Chevron deference.\n\nThose are both good, strong arguments – but not landmines that could explode administrative law. The potentially gigantic development in Digital Realty’s brief is in the final footnote, which offers a suggestion to the justices if they don’t buy either of Digital Realty’s reasons not to defer to the SEC under Chevron: “Should the court somehow conclude both that the statutory text is ambiguous and that the procedural defects in the SEC’s rulemaking can be excused, it should order supplemental briefing to consider whether Chevron should be overruled.”\n\nBoom! Digital Realty is inviting the justices to use the whistleblower case to reconsider the 30-year-old premise that courts owe deference to executive agencies in statutory interpretation.\n\nAs you know, Justice Neil Gorsuch elegantly argued in his previous job as a judge on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Chevron deference is an unconstitutional abdication of judicial and congressional power under separation-of-powers doctrine. Justice Clarence Thomas was mulling the same constitutional concerns about Chevron even earlier. In his 2015 concurrence in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, Justice Thomas said that Chevron deference vests the executive branch with power the Constitution has granted only to Congress. “Statutory ambiguity thus becomes an implicit delegation of rulemaking authority, and that authority is used not to find the best meaning of the text, but to formulate legally binding rules to fill in gaps based on policy judgments made by the agency,” Justice Thomas wrote.\n\nSo at least two justices are interested in exploring the constitutionality of Chevron deference. Will Digital Realty be their opportunity? The case is scheduled to be argued in less than three weeks, on Nov. 28. Digital Realty’s footnote seems to suggest that if the justices believe after that hearing that Chevron precedent calls for deference to the SEC’s interpretation of Dodd-Frank that it should then reopen the case to consider the much bigger question of whether such deference invests the executive branch with unconstitutional authority.\n\nIt’s unusual but certainly not unprecedented for the Supreme Court to broaden its consideration of cases that present important questions. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, for instance, the justices ordered post-argument briefing and eventually scheduled a second oral argument to expand the scope of the case to consider the constitutionality of campaign finance restrictions. Similarly, in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Supreme Court put aside the question it originally agreed to hear, corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute, and asked both sides to rebrief and re-argue the bigger issue of the extraterritorial reach of the law.\n\nThe court can easily sidestep Digital Realty’s landmine. The company’s lawyers at Williams & Connolly don’t even want the justices to think about the constitutionality of Chevron deference unless Digital Realty loses on its other arguments.\n\nBut as best as I can tell, Digital Realty is the first Supreme Court litigant since Justice Gorsuch joined the court to invite the justices to reconsider their Chevron precedent. This could be the start of something huge.\n\nI emailed Daniel Geyser of Stris & Maher, who represents whistleblower Somers, to ask about Digital Realty’s brief. He didn’t immediately get back to me.', 'Chevron deference landmine lurks in new brief in SCOTUS whistleblower case', -0.1, 13.2),

Now, the court has the opportunity to take up another case that could transform— or even end — the death penalty in America.\n\nIn 1972, a black man named William Henry Furman was caught, mid-burglary, by a homeowner in Georgia. Furman attempted to flee and in doing so tripped and fell, causing the gun he was carrying to fire and kill the resident. Furman v. Georgia asked the Supreme Court if the imposition (and carrying out) of the death penalty in Furman’s case constituted cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments. The answer, in a 5-4 decision, was yes.\n\nJustices William Douglas, Potter Stewart and Byron White came to the conclusion that entrenched racial biases caused an unacceptable level of arbitrariness in deciding who would receive the death penalty. Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan went a step further, coming to the shared conclusion that the death penalty in and of itself was cruel and unusual punishment and utterly incompatible with the evolving standards of decency of a civilized society. Justice Powell, in his opinion, famously wrote that the death penalty was imposed on a “capriciously selected random handful” and was “cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightening is cruel and unusual.” Furman v. Georgia resulted in a four-year-long moratorium on executions in the U.S., and each person on death row had their death sentence commuted to life in prison. A number of columnists across the country seemed to be in agreement that it was unlikely that the death penalty would ever exist again in the United States. Unfortunately, they were wrong.\n\nIn the wake of Furman, a number of states moved to entirely re-write their death penalty statutes in an attempt to prove that their systems for imposing the death penalty weren’t arbitrary. Ideally, this would have meant narrowing the imposition of capital punishment to the very worst crimes. What happened instead, somewhat ironically, was the number of crimes that are death-penalty eligible ballooning in number. In 1976, in Gregg v. Georgia, the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty by approving several states’ new laws.\n\nMany states have continued to add more and more aggravating factors that render someone eligible for the death penalty, including murder for hire and aggravated kidnapping. In 2015, Kelly Gissendaner was executed in Georgia for orchestrating the killing of her husband, even though she herself did not commit the murder.\n\nIn Arizona, the legislature has more than doubled its number of aggravating factors since the 1970s. When Abel Daniel Hidalgo was sentenced to death for first-degree murder in 2015, the state had approved so many aggravating circumstances that nearly everyone convicted of first-degree murder was now eligible for death. Hidalgo also produced evidence that showed that several neighboring Arizona counties were unable to pursue a death sentence in cases far more egregious than his due to simple budget constraints.\n\nIn early 2017, Neal Katyal, the former Solicitor General under Obama (most recently famed for his work as the lead attorney for Hawaii’s challenge of President Trump’s travel ban) agreed to represent Hidalgo’s case before the Supreme Court. Hidalgo’s team is asking the court to strike down Arizona’s death penalty and rule on the constitutionality of capital punishment nationwide. The administration of the death penalty in 2017, they argue, is in clear violation of the 8th Amendment, which holds that capital punishment must be reserved for only the worst offenders. Arizona’s current capital sentencing statute, which allows for 99 percent of first-degree murders to be death-eligible, does not meaningfully narrow the class of offenders eligible to be executed to “the worst of the worst.”\n\nThere were approximately 17,250 murders in the United States last year. There were 30 new death sentences imposed. Were these handed down in response to the most egregious crimes to the most irredeemable people? No. Their race, their socioeconomic status, their geographical location, and the quality of their lawyers — both defense and prosecutor — ultimately played the most decisive roles in which of them received a death sentence. Statistics tell us that it’s likely that 1 in 25 of those new death sentences was handed down to a person who was completely innocent of the crime. There are clear patterns of race of victim, or race of defendant, discrimination in courts across the country. A total of 20 white people have been executed for the murder of a black person, while 287 black people have been executed for the murder of a white person. 94.5 percent of prosecutors in death penalty states are white.', 'If This Case Is Heard By The Supreme Court, It Could End The Death Penalty', -0.3, 16.6),

And the defendant, Bayer, is based in New Jersey.\n\nSince a trial court rejected the company’s motion to dismiss the case last December, three major court decisions have significantly weakened the foundation of the plaintiff’s jurisdictional claims.\n\nIn late February of this year, the Missouri Supreme Court itself determined that plaintiffs cannot use the state’s courts to sue out-of-state companies which conduct significant business in Missouri for unrelated claims.\n\nIn that case, an Indiana resident was suing for personal injury that occurred in Indiana, but the litigation was taking place in Missouri under the premise that the defendant, Virginia based Norfolk Southern Railway, had significant operations in the Show-Me State.\n\nThere were also two U.S. Supreme Court cases that further weakened jurisdictional claims in the Missouri case.\n\nIn one of them in particular, the U.S. high bench held that courts in California don’t have jurisdiction to hear claims by out-of-state plaintiffs made against an out-of-state defendant. In that instance, more than 500 of 592 plaintiffs were from out of state.\n\nIn the case before the Missouri Supreme Court, the plaintiffs argue the state has jurisdiction over Bayer because the company conducted clinical trials in the state and develop its nationwide marketing campaign for the product in question in Missouri as well.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the Missouri clinical trials relate directly to all of their claims, regardless of their state of residence, because without those clinical trials and nationwide marketing from Missouri, none of them would have used the product.\n\nArguing for the lower court judge who found in favor of the plaintiffs, attorney Jonathon Cohn said it’s obvious Bayer undertook major operations in Missouri.\n\n“It’s what did Bayer do in the state of Missouri that then related to the causes of actions here,” said Cohn. “And here, we know that they did clinical trials that supported the approval of their PMA (Premarket Approval) process. And then they created this national advertising campaign that went out all over the United States and the world.”\n\nFurther, Cohn said plaintiffs’ claims of misrepresentation of the defective product have direct ties to Missouri. “It doesn’t matter where the plaintiffs heard these misrepresentations. The point is that they started in the state of Missouri. This is where they came from. And then they were projected outward.”\n\nThe Supreme Court judges peppered Cohn with questions challenging the line of thinking in his argument. At one point, Judge Laura Denvir Stith said he failed to link the out of state plaintiff’s claims to Missouri. “Council, I’m drawing the conclusion there’s no connection. So, if there is one, you should tell me what it is,” said Stith.\n\nRepresenting Bayer, attorney Sean Jez said the product in question, “Essure”, could be linked to the state in which it was manufactured, or the plaintiff’s home state, but not Missouri.\n\n“Essure was manufactured in California and abroad, but not in Missouri,” said Jez. “So, if you have a woman who obtains Essure in Oregon, she might be able to sue in Oregon where she lives, or California where Essure’s manufactured, but not in Missouri.”\n\nHe claimed the Plaintiff’s argument would allow for lawsuits to flood Missouri from anywhere in the world.\n\n“They’re trying to make the city of St. Louis a nationwide, indeed a worldwide hub for mass tort litigation, in which any woman, anywhere in the world from Austria to Australia, can file their claim in Missouri, because supposedly Missouri is the basis of one of the many clinical trials that are conducted all around the world.”\n\nChief Justice Zel Fischer seemed to back up the case being made by Jez, referencing the recent court decisions favoring Bayer’s jurisdiction argument. “There are certain doors regarding personal jurisdiction that are being shut, that weren’t shut when these cases were filed,” said Fischer. “And you’re winning those arguments.”\n\nIn what might be a signal of admission that Bayer could be in line for a favorable decision from the Missouri court, Cohn, the attorney for the lower court judge that found in favor of the plaintiffs, is filing an amended brief to the judges.\n\nBayer has not been successful in staving off many of the previous lawsuits involving the product, as courts have rejected the company’s claim that it was immune to such litigation because Essure had been federally approved for distribution.\n\nMore than 3,700 women have filed lawsuits against Bayer in the U.S., alleging harm from the device. In its annual statement earlier this year, the company noted it incurred impairment losses of $413 million in connection with Essure.\n\nThe sterilization, or permanent birth control device, is implanted in women. Among the claims from plaintiffs are that it causes cramps, pelvic pain, ovarian and uterine cysts, pregnancy, miscarriage and loss of libido.', 'State high court hears case to decide if lawsuit against national company can proceed in Missouri', -0.2, 11.4),

An earlier attempt to get the case sent back to state courts also failed when a federal judge denied the request.\n\nAbout a month after upholding the district court ruling, the appeals court denied a SLFPA-E request for rehearing, and petitioners in the case filed for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.

The filings will then be posted to the court\'s docket and made available to the public through the Court\'s website.\n\n\"Though the Supreme Court has moved glacially to join the rest of the judiciary in permitting online filing, that\'s better than not at all, and the institution should be commended for creating an e-filing system that, unlike PACER, will be free and easily accessible to the public,\" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court.\n\nScotusblog.com already obtains and posts many legal briefs and opinions and the Justice Department has an easily accessible archive of its extensive high court filings on its website.

When the justices issued their highly anticipated decision upholding President Barack Obama\'s health care overhaul in 2012, the court\'s website was overwhelmed. It, too, was recently overhauled to make it more accessible.\n\nOver the years, the justices have at times shown a glancing familiarity with technology. Some carry computer tablets with high court briefs loaded on them. But notes between justices are routinely sent on paper, definitely not by email.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts himself noted a few years back that the court stuck with pneumatic tubes to transmit newly released opinions from the courtroom to reporters waiting one floor below until 1971, long after their heyday.\n\nRoberts said that it\'s appropriate for courts \"to be late to the harvest of American ingenuity\" because their primary role is to resolve disputes fairly.\n\nThe Supreme Court updates come amid criticism of the PACER system as outmoded and unfair. \"The PACER system used by the lower federal courts is hopelessly outdated and cumbersome.

Beginning Monday, those documents should appear quickly on the court\'s website. People who can\'t afford to pay court costs will be allowed to file paper copies, which Supreme Court employees will scan and post online.\n\nNot everything is changing. Lawyers still will be required to submit up to 40 paper copies of every brief, and the court\'s color-coding system to distinguish types of briefs also will remain.\n\nThere\'s no timetable for electronic filings to supplant paper as the official court record.\n\nAnd there\'s also no expectation that the justices will drop their prohibition on cameras in the courtroom anytime soon.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who once sounded open to cameras, recently told a New York audience that cameras might detract from the robust exchanges during arguments.\n\nThe Supreme Court also refuses to livestream audio of its arguments, even as the federal appeals court just down Capitol Hill recently has allowed live audio access to its hearings.

Our family members and neighbors with intellectual disabilities — like everyone else — are able to do some things on their own, but need help doing other things.\n\nThe fans at Texas Special Olympics, who have watched nearly 60,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities compete over the years, know this to be true. They have seen people with intellectual disabilities excel at bowling, table tennis, soccer and other Special Olympics sports. They understand the significant challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities, but they also know how wrong it is to think that for people to be “good” at something, they must not have intellectual disabilities.\n\nBut look at how the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) handled Bobby Moore’s case. Moore is a man with a lifelong, documented intellectual disability who has been on death row since 1980. Two years ago, the CCA erroneously concluded that, since Moore could play pool and mow lawns, he must not have an intellectual disability. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned that decision and ruled in Moore’s favor, the CCA has the chance to set it right. With the Supreme Court’s decision, the CCA can go from being an outlier at odds with governing clinical principles to being an example of a court carefully adhering to them.\n\nA finding of intellectual disability can literally be a matter of life and death. The Supreme Court has held that people with intellectual disabilities are exempt from capital punishment. In the landmark decision of Atkins v. Virginia in 2002, the court ruled that, in light of their limitations, people with intellectual disability are not “the worst of the worst.” They can — and should — be held accountable and sentenced for crimes they commit, but under the Constitution, they cannot be executed.\n\nIn 2015, a Harris County District Court judge concluded that Moore — whose IQ is around 70 — has an intellectual disability and cannot be executed. The trial court emphasized his significant deficits — for example, his inability to tell time, to understand the seasons or the days of the week, or to perform basic addition as a teenager; his failure in every single grade in school, including first grade twice; and his persistence in eating from trash cans even after multiple bouts of food poisoning.\n\nThe CCA, however, disagreed that Moore has intellectual disability. The CCA erroneously focused on Mr. Moore’s “strengths” — his ability to mow lawns and play pool; the fact that he eventually was able to learn to read and write as an adult in prison. In the CCA’s mistaken view, Moore couldn’t have an intellectual disability because he was able to do some things well.\n\nThat view has no medical or scientific basis. Instead, whether intended or not, it perpetuates the harmful and dehumanizing stereotype that individuals with intellectual disabilities can’t be good at anything.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Supreme Court takes only a handful of cases each year, thankfully, it reviewed Moore’s case. In March, the court rejected the CCA’s ruling that Moore did not have an intellectual disability. The Supreme Court made clear that it was error to “overemphasize” his perceived strengths rather than focus on his significant deficits. The court resolved all issues in Moore’s favor and strongly endorsed the conclusions and recommendation of the Harris County trial court.\n\nNow that Moore’s case is back before the CCA, that court must decide whether it will: (1), continue to use harmful stereotypes to attempt to deny the existence of Moore’s intellectual disability; or (2), follow the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court and agree that Moore is intellectually disabled under current medical standards.\n\nThe proper resolution is simple. Moore’s death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment. Such a sentence would hold Moore accountable for his crime while respecting his constitutional rights. It would also allow him to be moved from solitary confinement and into the general prison population. Last week, the Harris County District Attorney’s Office agreed that in light of the Supreme Court’s decision and current medical standards, Moore is entitled to such relief as a person with intellectual disability.\n\nMore than 50 years ago, my uncle, President John F. Kennedy, on signing his last piece of legislation, the Community Mental Health Act, said that people with intellectual disabilities “need no longer be alien to our affections or beyond the help of our communities.” He and my mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the Special Olympics, began the long process of ending the stigma and fear that surround intellectual disabilities, but much more work remains to be done.\n\nWe cannot go back and change the marginalization that Bobby Moore experienced as a child and young man, or the fact that our systems failed to help him. Tragically, we cannot undo the crimes that he committed. But we can affirm his fundamental human dignity. I hope the CCA will choose life imprisonment for Bobby Moore. Such an action would clearly show that the CCA, rather than opposing current standards on intellectual disability, understands and applies them.', 'An opportunity for Texas on intellectual disability', -0.1, 16.5),

Clopton was the chief administrative law judge for the California Public Utilities Commission from 2009 to 2017, serves on the Board of Governors for the National Association of the Administrative Law Judiciary, and is the winner of the American Bar Association’s 2017 Robert P. Yegge Award for excellence in judicial administration.\n\nWhat kind of society do you want to live in? If you mention words like \"equal\" and \"fair,\" then you can imagine the importance of people using their right to vote, and the importance of our judicial system. Congress passes laws, but the Supreme Court and lower federal courts determine whether those laws are constitutional. Under the American system of democracy, a well-qualified federal judiciary is one of the most important checks on the legislative branch and on unbridled power by the executive branch. Yet both the legislative branch and the executive branch have a direct impact on the composition of the judiciary.\n\nOne of the truly memorable highlights of my three-decade legal career was being sworn into the United States Supreme Court Bar in 2015. Looking at the nine justices, I wanted to know who they were , where they came from, and where they studied law. Eight have served on United States Courts of Appeals, the level of courts just below the Supreme Court.\n\nOver its history, the Supreme Court has decided such issues as who is enslaved and who is free, who can vote, who can donate to political campaigns, who can marry, and who will be president. The court’s decisions about women’s reproductive rights and gender equality directly affect my personal freedom and yours. But the Supreme Court only considers less than 2% of the issues submitted to it every year, and the decisions made by the Courts of Appeals, as well the federal district courts beneath them, are enormously important to determining the kind of society we live in.\n\nThe U.S. Courts of Appeals are 13 courts that sit below the U.S. Supreme Court, consist of three judges, and do not use a jury. Several presidential executive orders, including the travel ban , DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) , and barring transgender people from the military, have been reviewed and often blocked by federal judges as a result of lawsuits by several civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nDuring President Barack Obama’s last year in office, the decision by Republican congressional leaders to block all federal judicial appointments had a lasting and negative impact on the federal courts. In November 2016, there were 102 federal judicial vacancies , including the Supreme Court seat for which the moderate judge Merrick Garland was nominated, and 59 pending nominations by President Obama.\n\nAs head of the executive branch, the president nominates individuals for vacancies on all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, and the Senate, by a simple majority, confirms the nominee. Once a judge is confirmed, the U.S. Constitution prescribes the term “shall hold their offices during good behavior.” This has turned out to mean for as long as they live, are in good health, and if they choose not to retire; many have served for 30 or more years.\n\nCurrently, there are over 140 federal judicial vacancies and the current administration is seeking to fill them with Republican partisans. When President Trump took office, there were 108 federal judicial vacancies. As of November 10, there are 145 vacancies and 47 pending nominations, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts . In the first week of November, four federal judges were confirmed for lifetime positions.\n\nThe Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress and Senate have the unprecedented opportunity to chart the direction of American law for the next several decades . To influence the kind of society you want to live in, keep watch over who is being nominated to federal judgeships.

It’s not a pretty world.”\n\nFor now, conservatives are reveling in their success. During the campaign, Mr. Trump shored up the support of skeptical right-wing voters by promising to select Supreme Court justices from a list Mr. McGahn put together with help from the Federalist Society and the conservative Heritage Foundation. Exit polls showed that court-focused voters helped deliver the president’s narrow victory. Now, he is rewarding them.\n\n“We will set records in terms of the number of judges,” Mr. Trump said at the White House recently, adding that many more nominees were in the pipeline. Standing beside the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, he continued, “There has never been anything like what we’ve been able to do together with judges.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAppellate judges draw less attention than Supreme Court justices like Neil M. Gorsuch, whom Mr. Trump installed in the seat that Justice Scalia’s death left vacant and that Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, refused to let Mr. Obama fill. But the 12 regional appeals courts wield profound influence over Americans’ lives, getting the final word on about 60,000 cases a year that are not among the roughly 80 the Supreme Court hears.\n\nNan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that her group considered many of Mr. Trump’s nominees to be “extremists” — hostile to the rights of women, minority groups and workers, and unduly favorable to the wealthy. But conservatives, who have rallied around Mr. Trump’s nominees as a rare bright spot of unity for the fractious Republican Party, see them as legal rock stars who will interpret the Constitution according to its text and original meaning.\n\nAnd they see tremendous opportunity in the fact that Mr. Trump is the first Republican president whose nominees can be confirmed by simple-majority votes, especially since he is likely to fill an unusually large number of vacancies. Mr. Trump started with 21 open appellate seats because after Republicans gained control of the Senate in 2015, they essentially shut down the confirmation process. Six additional appellate judgeships have opened since his inauguration, and nearly half of the 150 active appeals court judges are eligible to take senior status — semiretirement that permits a successor’s appointment — or will soon reach that age, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar.\n\nAlmost Half of Appeals Judges Are Eligible for Senior Status State of the federal appeals courts at the start of each president’s first term. President Median Judge Age Vacant Seats Senior-Eligible Seats Richard M. Nixon Nixon 59 10% 10% Gerald Ford Ford 59 3% 10% Jimmy Carter Carter 60 6% 14% Ronald Reagan Reagan 60 4% 15% George H.W.

Trump Trump 66 11% 44%\n\nAs a result, Mr. Trump is poised to bring the conservative legal movement, which took shape in the 1980s in reaction to decades of liberal rulings on issues like the rights of criminal suspects and of women who want abortions, to a new peak of influence over American law and society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“What makes this a unique opportunity in modern history is the sheer number of vacancies, the number of potential vacancies because of the aging bench, and the existence of a president who really cares about this issue in his gut,” said Leonard A. Leo, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump on courts who is the executive vice president of the Federalist Society.\n\nLiberals have accused Mr. Trump of outsourcing his nominations process to the Federalist Society. But two administration officials argued that this claim misunderstands how the conservative legal movement has matured as the generation of Republican lawyers shaped by reading the originalist dissents of Justice Scalia and by the bitter 1987 fight over Judge Robert H. Bork’s failed Supreme Court nomination has come of age. Mr. McGahn and nearly all the lawyers working for him at the White House are longtime society participants, so relationships built on the network of like-minded conservatives saturate discussions of potential nominees from the inside, they said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

Grassley, Republican of Iowa, in lowering impediments and keeping the confirmation assembly line moving.\n\nFor example, confirmation hearings have usually featured just one appellate hopeful at a time (along with several district judge nominees). But Mr. Grassley has scheduled three hearings this year with two appellate nominees — as many as took place during all eight years of the Obama administration, according to congressional aides.\n\nThe independent guardrail role of the American Bar Association, which has vetted potential judges since the Eisenhower administration — conducting confidential interviews with people who worked with them and rating their experience, integrity and temperament — is also weakening. Picks by presidents of both parties have sometimes run into trouble, but Republicans have accused the group of bias against conservatives.\n\nTraditionally, the group’s volunteers vet potential judges before the White House decides whether to send their names to the Senate, but Mr. Trump — like President George W. Bush — exiled it from that role, leaving it scrambling to evaluate nominees afterward. Already this year, Mr. Grassley has held hearings for four district judge nominees before the group finished its work — which happened with only seven during the eight Bush years.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe bar group later deemed two of them unqualified to be trial judges, saying they lacked sufficient trial experience. On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee nevertheless advanced both to the Senate floor. One, Holly Teeter, a 38-year-old federal prosecutor who fell just shy of the bar group’s minimum standard of 12 years of experience, gained bipartisan approval. But the other, Brett Talley, a 36-year-old with virtually no trial experience and who wrote politically charged blog posts on topics like gun rights, had a party-line vote.\n\nRepublicans may go further in ousting the group from its semiofficial gatekeeping role after it rated L. Steven Grasz, Mr. Trump’s nominee for the appeals court in St. Louis, as “not qualified” to be a judge, portraying him as “gratuitously rude” and unlikely “to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge” on matters like abortion. The White House is weighing telling future nominees not to sign confidentiality waivers that give A.B.A. evaluators access to disciplinary action records and not to interview with the bar group, an official said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservatives are also pressuring Mr. Grassley to reduce one of the few remaining constraints on letting a president with an allied Senate majority appoint whomever he wants to a life-tenured judgeship: the Judiciary Committee’s “blue slip” practice, named for the color of the paper that senators use to sign off on nominees for judgeships in their states.\n\nWhile it has been handled differently in different eras, throughout the Obama years, Mr. Grassley and his Democratic predecessor, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, refused to let the confirmation process proceed for nominees without two positive blue slips. That approach forces presidents to consult with senators and, when they are from opposite parties, incentivizes the compromise selection of relative moderates.\n\nSenator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has announced he will not return a blue slip for David R. Stras, an appeals court nominee who is a Minnesota Supreme Court justice and is on Mr. Trump’s short list for the United States Supreme Court, saying he was not meaningfully consulted and objected to him. (An administration official said the White House had primarily negotiated with Minnesota’s senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who did turn in a blue slip.) Conservatives want Mr. Grassley to hold a hearing anyway.\n\nDemocratic senators in Oregon and Wisconsin have also not turned in blue slips for pending appellate nominees, but the question of how much control senators will retain over judicial appointments in their states is not limited to partisan politics.\n\nSenator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, has not returned a blue slip for Kyle Duncan, an appeals court nominee who represented conservative clients in several culture-war cases, including whether corporations may refuse to provide contraception coverage to employees based on owners’ religious beliefs, and whether transgender students may be barred from using the school bathrooms of their gender identities.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network, an opaquely funded group that runs ads pressuring Democratic senators not to block Trump nominees, has begun airing ads in Louisiana supporting Mr. Duncan. Mr. Franken warned that if the blue-slip constraint eroded, Republican senators would lose, too — and not just when Democrats regained power.\n\nBut many conservatives want to take full advantage of their window of opportunity.

Perhaps the reader, in the waning second decade of the 21st century, thinks such an innovation might have been implemented, say, many years ago, as it was for the rest of the federal courts.\n\nThe reader is reminded that the Supreme Court is a place that still awards quills to lawyers who argue cases there.\n\nThe rollout will be slow and gradual and careful. And if you think the court is the least bit sheepish about this, well, there again, you haven’t spent much time at the marble palace.\n\n“The courts will often choose to be late to the harvest of American ingenuity,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote when announcing the online project at the end of 2014. “Courts are simply different in important respects when it comes to adopting technology, including information technology.”\n\n[Tech-wary Supreme Court investing more in digital age]\n\nRoberts said at the time that the online upgrade could come as “soon as 2016,” but it does little good to try to hurry things along.\n\n“The court does its own thing at its own pace,” said Thomas C. Goldstein, publisher of the independent Scotusblog, which was founded 15 years ago and is the go-to online site for those looking to read petitions and case documents filed with the court. (The American Bar Association publishes digital briefs in the cases the court accepts.)\n\n“Very little outside the building influences the justices’ thinking about what makes the most sense,” Goldstein said. “So it seems odd to people on the outside, but it really doesn’t surprise anyone who deals with the court regularly.”\n\nAs Roberts explained in that year-end report on the judiciary, the court’s primary responsibility is deciding the cases and controversies that come before it. Everything else—including public transparency—is a distant second.\n\nSo the court is interested in technology that helps its decision-making, Roberts explained, and warier of other technology — cameras, same-day audio, etc. — even if it might make the court more accessible to the public.\n\nThe justices are often called upon to decide cases involving the latest technology but have gotten a bad rap about their own familiarity with it. Justice Elena Kagan offhandedly told an audience in 2013 that the justices are not big fans of email. Drafts of opinions are printed and circulated among the nine.\n\nBut the court is not nearly as Luddite as its image. It has had a website, supremecourt.gov, since 2000, and its opinions are available there as soon as they are announced from the bench. Transcripts of oral arguments are available within hours. For reasons never quite explained, audio of oral arguments is posted at the end of the week following Monday through Wednesday arguments, instead of on the same day.\n\nBeginning this week, all documents filed by parties represented by a lawyer must also be filed electronically. (Prisoners and others sometimes represent themselves and file on paper).\n\nBut the official filings will still be those on paper, and follow the court’s detailed instructions.\n\nThe familiar booklet briefs — lawyers provide the court 40 copies each — are typeset in fonts of “the Century family” on paper that is “opaque, unglazed, and not less than 60 pounds in weight.” Their cover colors — white, orange, tan, light blue, light red, yellow, cream, light green, dark green — reflect their purpose: a merits brief, for instance, or a request that the court not accept a case.\n\nThe Supreme Court is developing its own online system, rather than being part of PACER, which serves the other federal courts. Viewing documents on supremecourt.gov will be free. PACER charges 10 cents a page, and is the subject of a class action suit about whether that fee is too high.\n\nThe court hasn’t explained why it developed its own system, but Roberts in 2014 repeatedly noted the court’s sense of caution.\n\n“Litigation often involves sensitive matters: Criminal prosecutions, bankruptcy petitions, malpractice suits, discrimination cases and patent disputes may all lead to the collection of confidential information that should be shielded from public view to protect the safety of witnesses, the privacy of litigants and the integrity of the adjudicatory process,” he wrote.\n\n“Courts understandably proceed cautiously in introducing new information technology systems until they have fairly considered how to keep the information contained therein secure from foreign and domestic hackers, whose motives may range from fishing for secrets to discrediting the government or impairing court operations.”\n\nOf course, as Roberts notes, the lower courts have dealt with such concerns for years. More than a billion documents are stored in the PACER system.\n\nMore important, Roberts said, was a reluctance to change what the justices feel is working.\n\n“Like other centuries-old institutions, courts may have practices that seem archaic and inefficient — and some are,” he wrote. “But others rest on traditions that embody intangible wisdom. Judges and court executives are understandably circumspect in introducing change to a court system that works well until they are satisfied they are introducing change for the good.”\n\nIn that 2014 report, Roberts noted that at the close of the 19th century, pneumatic tubes were revolutionizing the way American business worked. Air compressors could shoot containers of documents hundreds of feet in buildings. The court waited three decades before installing such a system to relay its opinions to the waiting press and then left it in place for decades.\n\nIn 1968, Roberts noted, The Washington Post’s Supreme Court correspondent, John P. MacKenzie, described the court’s process of transmitting decisions as “perhaps the most primitive . . . in the entire communications industry.”\n\nEveryone’s a critic.', 'The Supreme Court\'s next (cautious, careful) move into the digital age', 0, 13.5),

Greene’s Energy Group on Monday, November 27, 2017. This case will give the Supreme Court its first opportunity to address the constitutionality of the inter partes review procedures created by the America Invents Act (AIA). The issue specifically taken by the Supreme Court is as follows:\n\nWhether inter partes review – an adversarial process used by the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to analyze the validity of existing patents – violates the Constitution by extinguishing private property rights through a non-Article III forum without a jury.\n\nIn advance of this much anticipated hearing, I reached out to a number of industry insiders with a simple question: What are you thoughts and predictions on Oil States in advance of Supreme Court oral arguments? Their answers follow.\n\nAs for my thoughts — as I’ve said at various speaking engagements, I’ve made a career out of correctly predicting chaos when it comes to Supreme Court decisions. That means I’m going to go out on a limb this time with my prediction that the Supreme Court will find IPRs unconstitutional. We all know the Supreme Court does not ordinarily take Federal Circuit cases to affirm, although it does happen from time to time. With this particular issue there seems to be no reason to take the case, and they’ve refused to take the same issue several times. So what has changed? Justice Gorsuch is now on the Court. I believe the patent community is too myopically focusing on this case as a patent case. I believe this case may well be treated as an administrative case giving the conservatives on the Court an opportunity to say something profound about the growth of the Administrative State, which if true would inure to the benefit of those wanting a strong patent system and a dismissal of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board from the post grant challenge business.\n\nIn any event, once oral arguments are complete we will circle back with further articles and prognostications in advance of what should be a momentous decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nBob Stoll\n\nPartner, Drinker Biddle\n\nI think that Oil States is one of those rare cases that the Supreme Court takes up to affirm the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Supremes feel that they need to have some cases to balance all of the reversals they hand down and this is one of them. The chaos that could result from a reversal will drive the decision. If the Supreme Court decided that Article III judges are needed to invalidate patents what would happen with all of the cases already decided? What about the earlier Inter Partes Review decisions? What about third party reexamination? What about other administrative courts in other agencies handling other property-related issues? I also believe that the Supreme Court will deem patents to be a “quasi-public” right to explain its decision. The right would neither be fully private nor fully public, but a hybrid. This is how they will justify a decision that is necessitated by the trouble that would result from a reversal.\n\nRobert L. Stoll has more than 40 years of experience in intellectual property prosecution. Bob retired from the USPTO as Commissioner for Patents at the end of 2011 after a distinguished 34-year government career.\n\nStephen Kunin\n\nPartner, Oblon, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt, L.L.P.\n\nI predict that the Supreme Court will not strike down AIA trials as being unconstitutional. With that said the Supreme Court may focus more on the language of Article 1, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution on the scope of Congressional authority and discretion in enacting patent laws rather than on lightning rod issues of the right to jury trial and public v. private property aspect of patent grants. On the other hand, it would not surprise me if the Supreme Court in dicta criticizes how the AIA statutes have been implemented and urges that Congress and the Executive Branch to take action to make reforms to better balance the proceedings to make them more flexible.\n\nStephen Kunin serves as an expert witness and consultant on patent policy, practice and procedure. Mr. Kunin served three decades at the USPTO, including 10 years as Deputy Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy.\n\nMarc Adler\n\nCounsel, Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, PC\n\nI doubt that the Supreme Court will find IPRs unconstitutional. Joe Matal predicted at the AIPLA annual meeting that the constitutionality of IPR proceedings would be upheld by the Court without dissent. In support of this prediction is the fact that the Federal Circuit denied en banc review in this case 10-2 and the Supreme Court has repeatedly denied petitions on the same issue, see MCM Portfolio v. Hewlett-Packard; Cooper v. Lee; and Cooper v. Square. It is also interesting to note that the Supreme Court will hear SAS Institute v. Lee, another IPR related case that asks whether the PTAB must issue a final written decision on all claims challenged, at the same time as Oil States. If IPRs are unconstitutional, then there is little need to determine whether a final written decision must address all claims challenged. Like Joe Matal, consumers of the proceedings do not seem to be worried. The number of IPR petitions filed after Oil States was granted cert is comparable to historical rates. This reflects continued confidence in the IPR system. Should the unlikely happen, I predict that we will simply move forward to rectify the timing of the challenges to occur prior to the grant of a patent right.\n\nMarc Adler is an intellectual property attorney and strategist with Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, PC. Prior to joining the firm Marc spent more than 25 years at Rohm & Haas, a Fortune 100 company, serving as the company as assistant general counsel and chief IP counsel.\n\nErik Oliver\n\nPartner, Richardson Oliver Law Group\n\nOne might be excused for thinking IPR is in trouble, many of the amicus briefs in support of neither party seem to tilt heavily against IPR. In contrast, the FantasySCOTUS crowd wisdom as of late October leans heavily the other way (estimating that IPR will be found constitutional unanimously). My own prediction: IPRs will be upheld. My primary rationale rests on (1) a generally anti-patent owner trend in outcomes across several decades of Supreme Court decisions and (2) the fact that the unanimous Supreme Court outcome in Cuozzo from 2016 lacks any dicta in the concurring-in-part opinions that would suggest concern about Article III issues. As to the second point, while it is true that the Supreme Court is not required (nor does it regularly) raise issues sua sponte, it just strikes me as too odd for them have upheld details of the IPR process with some concurrences and not even generated any dicta about the validity of the proceeding itself.\n\nWith an ever greater proportion of products in the market necessarily incorporating and practicing hundreds of thousands of innovations (and thus patents), a more robust mechanism for challenging weak patents was needed. Congress recognized this and created IPRs. IPRs delivered by shifting the cost curve for a patent challenge from one-million plus dollars to on the order of one-hundred thousand dollars. This shift has changed the landscape in a positive way for many industries. Particularly, helping clear the NPE landscape. For industries where there are fewer patents per product, the patent-value/protection cheese has moved; however, the answer is not to blame IPRs (or the PTAB). But to recognize that the IPR process affords opportunities to more cost effectively challenge weaker patents and deliver products into markets that your company had previously avoided due to the high cost of patent challenges.\n\nMr. Oliver counsels clients on a variety of patent and business matters, including licensing, buying, selling, valuation, prosecution and business processes. Prior to founding the ROL Group, Mr. Oliver was a Vice President at ThinkFire Services USA, Ltd’s Silicon Valley office.\n\nEdward Kwok\n\nPartner, VLP Law Group\n\nThe Federal Circuit’s 2015 holding that patents are “public property rights” in MCM Portfolio v. HP underlies the dispute in this case. Neither the brief by Petitioner (Oil States Energy’s Services) brief, arguing for private property rights, nor the briefs by the two Respondents (Greene’s Energy Group and the U.S. Solicitor General), arguing for public property rights, seem convincing. Indeed, the Respondents’ argument that Congress intends the Inter Partes Review (IPR) to be a vehicle by which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) corrects its own mistakes seem especially contrived, given that the petitioner of an IPR certainly plays a much bigger role than merely bringing to the USPTO’s attention that it has made a mistake in granting the patent. The Solicitor General’s Brief opens strongly in arguing that patents are not “natural rights” but a creature of “positive law,” but inexplicably fails to follow through to a compelling result. The Court may find a more reliable footing in the amicus brief by “27 Law Professors,” which argues from the historical viewpoint that patents — at least in American jurisprudence of the 19th and 20th centuries — were consistently seen as private property rights.\n\nI think it is likely that the Court will resolve the issue in favor of private property rights, overruling MCM, but it is not clear to me that such a ruling would mandate the Court to require a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. Again, neither Petitioner’s brief nor Respondent’s brief address that issue convincingly. I think the Court will struggle to save the USPTO’s IPR jurisdiction. One possibility would be to treat an IPR invalidation like an invalidation at the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), i.e., the invalidation is not binding, unless affirmed by a judicial appeal. That result, of course, would also necessarily strike down the statutory estoppel provisions in the IPR statute. Would the Court risk further confusion by so holding? That seems unlikely. Perhaps, the Court does not have a choice but to find the IPR unconstitutional in its entirety.\n\nEdward Kwok is a partner with VLP Law Group. His practice focuses on patent prosecution and Inter Partes adverse proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and intellectual property litigations in state and federal courts.\n\nJosh Lorentz (left)\n\nOleg Khariton (right)\n\nDinsmore & Shohl LLP\n\n\n\nThere is no question that, since its introduction just over five years ago, the inter partes review process has had a dramatic impact on U.S. patent litigation as well as the U.S. patent system as a whole, though of course there is some debate about whether, on the whole, this impact has been positive or negative. A ruling in favor of Oil States striking down the IPR process would have similarly massive consequences, even if the full extent of those consequences (particularly on patents that have already been invalidated by the PTAB) might not become immediately clear. Given the Federal Circuit’s recent track record at the Supreme Court, it might be tempting to see the fact that the justices have agreed to hear this case in the first place as an indication that they are getting ready to hand down another reversal. But in contrast to past cases, the question presented here goes far beyond challenging the validity of the Federal Circuit’s interpretation of a statute, and instead invites the Supreme Court to strike down the IPR statute in its entirety as an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative powers—which, needless to say, is an altogether different proposition.\n\nOn balance, the legal and policy arguments in favor of upholding the IPR statute appear to be stronger. One thing that will be interesting to watch is whether, in the event the statute is upheld (as seems probable), the Court will nonetheless seek to provide patent owners with a measure of relief. The Court may well decide to signal to the PTO that the agency has pursued the congressional mandate to invalidate weak patents too zealously, and that it should strive (through its rulemaking authority or otherwise) to make the IPR process more friendly to patent owners, for example by making it easier to amend claims. Similarly, the Court might signal to the Federal Circuit that it needs to take on a more active role in policing the PTO’s implementation of the statute.\n\nJosh Lorentz is chair of Dinsmore & Shohl LLP’s Intellectual Property Department and practice group chair of the firm’s IP Litigation and Licensing Practice, where he manages IP litigation, as well as trademark, copyright, privacy and social media matters.

He tried to flee on foot but was caught by tracking dogs, court and newspaper records show. At the time, he was on bail for shooting at a couple across the Arkansas River.\n\nBenson was convicted of charges connected to the rape, car theft and shooting. About a month after his 18th birthday, he was found to be a habitual offender and sentenced to 60 years without parole.\n\nBenson, now 32, will be eligible for release in 2062. He is incarcerated at the Maximum Security Unit near Tucker in Jefferson County.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has said states cannot lock away teens for life without parole in nonhomicide cases, and earlier this year, Arkansas lawmakers extended second chances to offenders serving life sentences for murders they committed as teens.\n\nNeither relief has been applied to Benson, however, because his lengthy sentence involves a term of years and his crimes didn\'t involve killing.\n\nIn a lawsuit en route to the Arkansas Supreme Court, Benson challenges the fairness of his sentence and others like it, arguing that he is serving a \"de facto\" life term because of the likelihood that he will die in prison.\n\nThe suit claims that such lengthy terms, when given to teenagers for nonhomicide offenses, fall short of the U.S. Supreme Court\'s declared right to a \"meaningful opportunity\" at release for such offenders.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court unanimously rejected that argument as recently as 2015, in Proctor v. Hobbs. That case involved another state inmate, Terrance Proctor, who challenged his term of 240 years for a string of aggravated robberies committed when he was 17.\n\nBut last month, the Arkansas justices appointed Jeff Rosenzweig to represent Benson, who up to that point had represented himself and had his case dismissed in a lower court.\n\nIn his original appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court -- written on his own behalf -- Benson argued that his 60-year sentence is \"functionally equivalent\" to life, because statistics peg his life expectancy at 73 but he won\'t be eligible for release until he\'s 77.\n\nThe brief also noted that prison life is not likely to contribute to Benson\'s long-term health.\n\nState attorneys, on the other hand, argued that such lengthy sentences -- while likely to exceed an offender\'s life expectancy -- are not unconstitutional.\n\nIn a recent interview at his Little Rock offices, Rosenzweig said emerging science has caused courts and lawmakers alike to rethink giving the harshest sentences to teens.\n\n\"Your average 16-, 17-year-old, no matter what the circumstances of his raising ... his brain simply has not developed, has not matured,\" Rosenzweig said. \"You\'re not talking about not punishing people, you\'re talking about essentially incarcerating them during the prime of their lives.\"\n\nSimilar reasoning was applied by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2010 Graham v. Florida decision.\n\nThe U.S. high court has not said, however, at what point a term of years becomes equal to a guaranteed life sentence. Nor did the justices shut the door on life terms for youths: Offenders can still spend their entire adult lives in prison if deemed ineligible for parole.\n\nRosenzweig said it\'s unclear how either U.S. justices or lawmakers intended to treat nonhomicide cases such as Benson\'s. He said Arkansas lawmakers created similar ambiguity when they passed juvenile sentencing changes in March.\n\nBut what is clear, he said, is that if Benson had killed someone and received a life sentence, the state\'s new juvenile resentencing law could have made him eligible for parole decades sooner. The law passed with broad support of the Legislature in March.\n\nThe Fair Sentencing of Minors Act, or Act 539 of 2017, was touted as an end to life-without-parole sentences for youths in Arkansas.\n\nThe law also established a new system through which youthful offenders would be eligible for parole: Those convicted of capital murder could go before the state Parole Board after 30 years; after 25 years for first-degree murder; and 20 years for anyone not convicted of murder. (The Arkansas Supreme Court in September allowed several convicted murderers to bypass the law and seek completely new sentences in the courts.)\n\nThe problem for Benson, Rosenzweig said, is that language that made the new parole scheme retroactive for murderers did not clearly apply the same leniency to offenders locked up for nonhomicide offenses in their youths.\n\nThe lead sponsor of the bill, Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, said the language was narrowly tailored to appease state prosecuting attorneys, who opposed similar legislation that failed in 2015.\n\n\"2017, we came back and it was a concerted effort to work with all the stakeholders on the language,\" Irvin said, recalling that there were no objections at the time.\n\nLori Kumpuris, an attorney with the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association who worked with lawmakers on the language, said she couldn\'t recall why the bill was written in such a way that nonhomicide offenders already in prison were not made eligible for the new parole scheme.\n\nShe added that prosecutors haven\'t received any complaints about the way the law treats nonhomicide offenders.\n\nIn the spring of this year, the state Public Defender Commission had identified more than 40 convicted murderers still serving life-without-parole sentences. But the number of prisoners serving lifelong sentences measured in years -- instead of having their sentence stamped \"life without parole\" -- has been harder to determine.\n\nAs part of his research for Tyrell Benson vs. Wendy Kelley, Director of the Department of Correction, Rosenzweig said he\'s attempting to compile a list of offenders sentenced as youths who are likely to die in prison. He named a couple of other cases he\'s worked on in the past, but beside cases familiar to him, Rosenzweig said the list is far from complete.\n\nGregg Parrish, the public defender coordinator, also declined to speculate how many prisoners may be serving such sentences.\n\nAccording to the Arkansas Department of Correction, there are 88 prisoners serving sentences of 40 or more years, but not life, for crimes committed before their 18th birthdays. Less than half of those inmates, 36, are serving time for nonhomicide offenses.\n\nThere are eight inmates in Arkansas\' prisons serving a total term of 100 or more years for homicide or other offenses committed in their youth.\n\nWith jurisdiction over roughly 18,000 inmates, a little more than 10 percent of all prisoners in Arkansas are serving terms of more than 40 or more years, but not life or death sentences, according to prisons spokesman Solomon Graves.\n\nA May report by the Washington, D.C.-based Sentencing Project found more than 2,000 offenders in prisons across the country serving de facto life sentences -- 50 years or more -- for crimes committed before their 18th birthdays. The report noted that blacks and other minority youths were more likely to receive such sentences.\n\nOnly Maine and West Virginia had no prisoners serving life or de facto life sentences for crimes committed by youths, the report noted.\n\n\"I do understand that the quagmire happens with some of these cases,\" Irvin, the state senator said. \"We may have to come back and change some of the language in 2019.\" She was referring to the next regular session of the Legislature.\n\nRosenzweig said he expects the matter to go before the Arkansas Supreme Court before then, with oral arguments possible in the spring of 2018 and a decision before the court breaks for next summer\'s recess. For now, he is in the process of writing a new brief out of Benson\'s pro-se arguments.\n\nUltimately, because state and federal courts are split on de facto life sentences, he said the matter is ripe for an ultimate decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAs for Benson, prison records show that he earned his GED within a few years of his prison term and has completed courses in anger management, substance abuse education and parenting. He has also racked up a series of disciplinary violations in the past two years, mostly for the possession or manufacture of contraband. All are matters that could be considered by the Parole Board should Benson become eligible.\n\nSundayMonday on 11/12/2017', 'Sentencing shifts skip some offenders', -0.2, 20.8),

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) delivers pastries to Senate staff after speaking on the Senate floor more than 15 hours in protest of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, at the Capitol in Washington, April 5, 2017. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times) - Bulletin\n\nA- A+\n\nAre decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court valid?\n\nThat’s simply a question. So it comes with a whiff of innocence about it. But what if a U.S. senator were to take to the Senate floor and ask the same question while implying that the answer is “no”? A frustrated Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., did just that recently.\n\nTo understand Merkley’s frustration, you have to go back a bit. Merkley and other Democrats were upset when Republicans refused to allow President Obama’s nomination to the Supreme Court to move forward. When Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Democrats were even more upset. Then Republicans in the Senate changed the Senate rules and shattered a filibuster Democrats staged to block Gorsuch.\n\nAs a result, Trump and Republicans were successful in restoring a narrow 5-4 conservative majority to the bench. That could have significant implications for what the court decides is the law of the land.\n\nThe roots of Merkley’s frustration may go back further. After all, his leadership in 2013 led to Democrats taking the first step to weaken the rules for filibusters for nominees for lower courts and the executive branch. Republicans followed in Merkley’s footsteps and weakened filibusters further. That must sting.\n\nMerkley took to the Senate floor recently to speak about the effect Gorsuch’s appointment would have on a high-profile case, Janus v. AFSCME. A vote by the narrow conservative majority seems likely to decide that public employees who choose not to join unions don’t have to pay fees in lieu of union dues, as many do now.\n\n“Now, should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch’s name? Should even a 5-4 decision with Gorsuch in the majority even carry weight here in our society?” Merkley said. “Because this is the seat that for the first time in U.S. history was stolen from one president and delivered to another. The majority of this body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity, dishonoring the oath, responsibility for advice and consent, and damaging the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.”\n\nWe suppose it feels good for Merkley to call the credibility of the nation’s highest court into question as a way of venting his frustration. It probably felt good a few years ago for Merkley and his colleagues to weaken filibuster rules in order to pack lower federal courts. We all know how that turned out, and Merkley should keep that in mind. Working to erode the Supreme Court’s credibility is likely to seem a mistake to Merkley when Democrats get their turn to nominate a justice or two.\n\n18691820', 'Editorial: Merkley should not challenge court\'s legitimacy', 0, 7.5),

The complaint was filed on behalf of a pro-life pregnancy care network, and two pregnancy care centers.\n\nCalifornia’s Assembly Bill 775, called the Reproductive FACT Act, requires licensed medical centers that offer free pro-life help to pregnant women to post a notice saying that California provides free or low-cost abortion and contraceptive services. The notice must include a phone number for a county office that would refer women to Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers.\n\nUnder the law, unlicensed pregnancy centers must also add large disclosures about their status as a non-medical provider, even if they do not provide medical services.\n\nThe petition, filed in March, charges that the legislation was enacted with the aim of targeting pro-life pregnancy centers based on their viewpoint that discourages abortion.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom said that courts have invalidated similar laws or parts of similar laws in Austin, Texas; Baltimore and Montgomery County, Maryland; and New York City.\n\nThe California legislature said that 200 pregnancy centers used “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices” that confuse and misinform women and intimidate them “from making fully-informed, time-sensitive decisions about critical health care.”\n\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law. Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel, said the state of California has “a substantial interest in the health of its citizens, including ensuring that its citizens have access to and adequate information about constitutionally protected medical services like abortion,” according to the New York Times.\n\nJudge Nelson said the notice “informs the reader only of the existence of publicly funded family-planning services” and “does not contain any more speech than necessary, nor does it encourage, suggest or imply that women should use those state-funded services.”\n\nBut Elissa Graves, legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, contended that the law enables the abortion industry.\n\n“Planned Parenthood, which makes millions from abortion, deceives women into believing that abortion is their only choice,” Graves said.\n\n“Pregnancy care centers, which provide their care for free, were established specifically to help women understand that they have the choice of life for their children, and that they will be there to help them through their pregnancies.”', 'Abortion info required at pro-life centers?

They claim that California\'s legally mandated disclosures violate the First Amendment rights of faith-based centers by forcing them to disclose information about abortions, which goes against the organizations\' beliefs. The California law in question is known as the Reproductive FACT Act and was passed two years ago. According to the Los Angeles Times , it was passed based on state lawmakers\' conclusion that \"as many as 200 pregnancy centers in the state sometimes used \'intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices that often confuse, misinform, and even intimidate women\' about their options for medical care.\"\n\nThe law as it stands also requires these crisis pregnancy centers to disclose whether they have a medical license or have medically licensed professionals available. Centers must also post a notice in the waiting room with the following statement: \"California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, including all FDA-approved methods of contraception, prenatal care, and abortion.”\n\nThese anti-abortion pregnancy centers do provide valuable resources for vulnerable women: They offer critical services and products like ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, and free diapers.

The Reproductive FACT Act, she declared, violates constitutionally protected freedom of speech, as it compels speech of a political or cultural nature.\n\nSuch \"is not the tool of a free government,\" warned Trask.\n\n\"Compelled speech must be subject to reasonable limitation,\" she affirmed. \"This statute compels the clinic to speak words with which it profoundly disagrees when the state has numerous alternative methods of publishing its message.

But in trying to stop some centers from fraudulent advertising, the state of California passed legislation that may violate their First Amendment rights.\n\nAccording to NARAL ProChoice America, California has around 170 crisis pregnancy centers, with around 40 percent licensed as medical clinics.\n\nUnder a law that took effect in January 2016, California pregnancy centers are required to disclose whether they are licensed medical providers or merely offer ancillary services (such as counseling or a clothing bank) to pregnant women. That part isn\'t controversial. But the law also requires crisis pregnancy centers that are licensed health clinics to notify patients about state programs that can help low-income women pay for prenatal care, contraception...and abortions. Clinics that fail to post the required state notice face civil penalties.\n\nNaturally, the anti-abortion crowd running most of California\'s crisis pregnancy centers doesn\'t want to be forced to provide pregnant women with this information. In October 2015, two centers—A Woman\'s Friend Pregnancy Resource Clinic of Marysville, California, and the Crisis Pregnancy Center of Northern California—filed a suit challenging the law.\n\nThe groups, represented by the Pacific Justice Institute, claim the law \"unconstitutionally compels [crisis pregnancy centers] to speak messages that they have not chosen, with which they do not agree, and that distract, and detract from, the messages they have chosen to speak.\" In addition, \"disseminating the mandated state message...is inconsistent with plaintiffs\' religious convictions.\" The suit says the regulations violate both freedom of religion and freedom of speech.\n\nSince then, several other groups have brought lawsuits challenging the same law.

Passed in 2015, the law requires the state’s licensed pregnancy centers to display a brief statement with a number to call for access to free and low-cost birth control and abortion care.\n\nUnlicensed centers must disclose that they are not medical facilities.\n\nThe challengers argue the disclosure violates their First Amendment free speech and religious exercise rights because it requires the religiously affiliated institutes send a message that conflicts with their mission of promoting childbirth—despite misleading clients in the process.\n\nA crisis pregnancy center in Massachusetts demonstrates how far anti-choice groups may go to dupe patients into believing a fake clinic offers the services they are seeking, as Rewire Investigate Reporter Amy Littlefield has found in a recent investigation.\n\nAppreciate our work? Rewire is a non-profit independent media publication. Your tax-deductible contribution helps support our research, reporting, and analysis. DONATE NOW\n\nAttorneys on behalf of the State of California argue the law is within the state’s power to regulate the medical profession. They note state lawmakers passed the law in response to legislative hearings and findings that showed more than 200 CPCs in the state misled potential clients into believing the clinics provided comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion.\n\nAttorneys for ADF sued before the law could take effect in January 2016. Both the lower court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of the disclosures, holding they fell within California’s broad power to regulate medical providers to protect patients. The Ninth Circuit also said that the disclosures did not violate the First Amendment because they stated facts and did not “encourage” people to seek an abortion as attorneys for ADF claim.\n\nThe CPC challenge is not the first time the federal courts have stepped into the fight over free speech rights and regulating abortion clinics or procedures. In 2015, the Supreme Court left intact a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit blocking North Carolina’s mandatory ultrasound law. That law required a physician (or qualified technician) to perform an ultrasound on a patient needing an abortion at least four hours, and no more than 72 hours, before the patient has an abortion.\n\nUnder the law, the physician or technician must display and describe the ultrasound image whether or not the patient objects, and even if the patient seeks to avoid the state-mandated speech and image by covering their ears and eyes. The law mandated these “display and describe” ultrasounds take place with no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, those that posed serious health risks to the patients, or instances of severe fetal anomalies.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit said North Carolina’s ultrasound law was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment free speech rights of doctors, by mandating an anti-abortion message promoted by the state.\n\nThe Roberts Court in November 2013 also refused to review a similar law from Oklahoma. That refusal left in place a ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court permanently blocking the measure as unconstitutional.\n\nThere is a difference between truth-in-advertising laws that have been upheld and the mandatory ultrasound laws that have not. As the Ninth Circuit noted in upholding the California law, disclosing that a CPC does not offer abortion, that the State of California provides comprehensive reproductive health care counseling should the patient want it, and that unlicensed clinics are just that—unlicensed—is not coercive. The CPCs could meet those disclosure requirements and still pressure patients into carrying pregnancies to term. Laws like California’s just prevent such centers from doing so in a fraudulent and misleading fashion—by hiding facts from patients.\n\nCourts have distinguished between compelled speech and speech that is misleading and therefore not constitutionally protected when considering whether to block mandatory ultrasound laws under the First Amendment. As the Fourth Circuit observed when permanently blocking North Carolina’s ultrasound mandate, that law compelled “a health care provider to act as the state’s courier” and to “disseminate the state’s message discouraging abortion, in the provider’s own voice, in the middle of a medical procedure, and under circumstances where it would seem the message is the provider’s and not the state’s.”\n\nUnlike truth-in-advertising laws regulating CPCs, these mandatory ultrasound laws conveyed a specific anti-abortion message and used doctors as a mouthpiece. Requiring an unlicensed fake clinic to disclose that it is unlicensed is simply stating a fact. It is not compelling the CPC to deliver a pro-abortion message from the state.\n\nThese cases share another thing in common, beyond generally falling in the category of free-speech challenges to abortion rights regulations. In both instances anti-choice advocates have tried to advance their agenda through deceiving patients. But the cases the Court agreed to hear Monday go one step further than just deceiving patients. The question the Roberts Court will now consider is whether CPCs have a religious right to deceive patients.\n\nThat framing—one of a religious objection to abortion rights— could be a tempting one for the Court. It falls in line with the Hobby Lobby v. Burwell reasoning that businesses and their owners can raise religious objections to reproductive health-care services. In the case of Hobby Lobby, it was its employees’ access to contraception through the Affordable Care Act. That framing privileged the rights of corporations over the rights of working people. These cases give the Court the opportunity to balance the rights of patients not to be lied to against the rights of religiously affiliated CPCs to promote an anti-abortion agenda by failing to disclose information to help a patient make an informed decision about their care.\n\nWill the Roberts Court center patients’ rights in these cases? Or, like it did in the Hobby Lobby case, will the Court barely acknowledge those rights in favor of creating more legal protections for businesses under the guise of promoting religious freedom? My guess is the latter. We’ll know for sure this summer when the Court issues its decision.

But I wanted to briefly break in here to note the pending federal courts/national security cases of Dalmazzi/Cox/Ortiz v. United States. The cases concern the legality of appointments to the Guantanamo U.S. Court of Military Commission Review and are being very well litigated by a team led by Texas law professor Steve Vladeck.\n\nFor my purposes, what is especially interesting, though, is that the cases come to the Supreme Court from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), a so-called Article I Court that provides a second layer of appellate review over military sentences. The court has asked the parties to discuss CAAF’s jurisdiction, apparently interested in a technical argument made by the government that there is no appellate jurisdiction whenever the CAAF grants and then vacates a petition for review.\n\nBut I wanted to note that there is another, more basic jurisdictional question in the case, one that might nonetheless escape attention: Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to directly review decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces at all?\n\nIn a recent amicus brief in another case, Virginia law professor Aditya Bamzai argued not. The Constitution says that the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law is appellate, not original. And according to no less an authority than Marbury v. Madison, Congress cannot move any cases from the court’s appellate jurisdiction to the original jurisdiction. This means that the Supreme Court can directly review the CAAF only if the case is an appeal, which in Bamzai’s view (and mine) means that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction only if the CAAF is truly a court, in the constitutional sense.\n\nBamzai argued that the CAAF is not a court, in the constitutional sense, but is a part of the executive branch, staffed by executive-branch appointees who are not given the tenure and protections of Article III. In a blog post responding to Bamzai last year, Vladeck argued that CAAF was in fact a court.\n\nI am inclined to agree with Bamzai that the CAAF is not a court, for reasons that I will elaborate on eventually in a paper on so-called legislative courts. But in a nutshell, I think that a court, in the constitutional sense, must be a body that exercises the judicial power of some government and that the CAAF does not exercise any government’s judicial power. (For instance, federal courts exercise “the judicial power of the United States.” State courts exercise “the judicial power” of their respective states. Etc. CAAF falls into none of these categories.)\n\nBut whoever is right or wrong about the CAAF’s status, it seems to me a serious and hard jurisdictional problem, and one that the Supreme Court ought to address, with the benefit of full briefing, at some point. (I should note that the Supreme Court has directly reviewed cases from the CAAF before, without noting or grappling with the jurisdictional problem. According to the court, this means that no precedent on jurisdiction was established, though in theory the court is supposed to notice jurisdictional defects even if the parties do not point them out.)', 'Supreme Court jurisdiction over the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces', 0, 6.2);

Given that Moore, as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court defied federal court orders and was removed from office — not once but twice! — it seems astonishing and outrageous that Republican voters chose him as a U.S. Senate candidate, leading to the current wave of sex-related allegations against him.\n\nIf you sense frustration in my tone, you\'re not wrong. The point of a free press is to inform the public about the character and the beliefs of the people they will be voting for. And to me, at least, it has seemed clear since 2003 that Moore is unfit to hold public office.\n\nIn fact, there is something deep about the reality that Moore\'s public career wasn\'t ended by his earlier defiance of the rule of law yet now appears likely to be ended by his sexual conduct. The lesson is this: To bring down a politician, it\'s not enough to show that he has violated your principles. You have to show that he\'s violated his own.\n\nTo his supporters, Moore\'s defiance of the federal courts on issues of church and state and on gay marriage were acts of principled civil disobedience, not dangerous threats to the very notion of legality. In contrast, no one really thinks it\'s OK for a 32-year-old man to make sexual advances on a 14-year-old girl. That includes evangelical voters, notwithstanding lame attempts to invoke religion in Moore\'s defense.\n\nConsider the conduct that got Moore expelled from the Alabama chief justiceship on two occasions. The first time, he had erected a 5,200-pound granite statue of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court courthouse. This was a rather obvious violation of the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, and a federal district court so held. When Moore was ordered to take it down, he refused. To almost any lawyer and most non-lawyers, it seems obvious that defying a federal judicial order is wrongful conduct, especially for someone who\'s elected position makes him the chief partisan of the rule of law in his state.\n\nTo Moore\'s supporters, however, the whole point of the exercise was to show that God\'s law — literally in the form of the Ten Commandments — trumped the Constitution made by man. According to their values, Moore was in the right, his actions not hypocritical but consistent.\n\nSeen from that standpoint, Moore\'s extended and unlawful resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court\'s decision on gay marriage was similarly principled. Never mind that it is well-supported law that the U.S. Supreme Court, not the state supreme courts, has the last word on the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. Never mind that Alabama of all places shouldn\'t be a venue for state resistance to federal authority when it comes to equal rights. As far as Moore\'s supporters were concerned, he was standing up for God\'s law, which he and maybe they take ahead of the law of the United States.\n\nThe fact that I and others like me consider it a violation of the oath of office to defy the Constitution was not, in the end, very important to the people who voted for Moore. That\'s because they don\'t share my values on this point, or at least they were prepared to forgive Moore because they care so much about the Ten Commandments and the immorality of gay marriage. Indeed, the fact that Moore was sanctioned for his wrongdoing by losing his position presumably made him seem like a civil disobedience martyr — a Martin Luther King Jr. for the evangelical right.\n\nMoore\'s real problems began only when it was alleged that he was a hypocrite, that his actions violated even the values he claims to espouse. That\'s why it\'s significant that he directly denied the allegation that he had gotten undressed with a 14-year-old, touched her sexually and guided her to do the same. This action is of course morally wrong, but what matters more is that it was morally wrong according to Moore\'s own values and those of his supporters. Even if some people might be prepared to forgive Moore\'s hypocrisy as a civil disobedience martyr, they would in this case be forgiving conduct that they acknowledge to be deeply bad.\n\nWhich is also why the effort by Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler to compare Moore to the biblical Joseph, the husband of Jesus\'s mother, Mary, is particularly pathetic. Obviously, the comparison is religiously unconvincing, bordering on sacrilegious. Scripture is silent on Joseph\'s age, and Mary\'s age, and any disparity that may have existed between them. What is so obviously absurd it that anyone making such a justification knows full well that they are trying to justify immoral conduct.\n\nThe upshot is that there\'s a good reason it has come to this. Wrongful conduct is in the eye of the beholder, and anyone who beholds Roy Moore now should see that he is unfit to serve.\n\nBloomberg View\n\nNoah Feldman is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Bob Goodlatte’s (R-Va.) retirement will open the door to long-awaited federal legislation addressing states’ taxing authority over remote retailers.\n\nGoodlatte—a long-time proponent of U.S. Supreme Court law restricting states’ ability to tax out-of-state sellers—formally announced Nov. 9 that he won’t seek re-election in 2018.\n\nThe Supreme Court soon could reconsider Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, a 1992 decision prohibiting states from imposing state sales and use tax collection obligations on vendors that don’t have a physical presence in-state. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley (R) has requested the high court review a state Supreme Court ruling that found the state’s “economic nexus” law, S.B. 106 (codified as S.D. Codified Laws Chapter 10-64), unconstitutional under Quill ( South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., U.S., No. 17-494, friend-of-the-court briefs filed 11/2/17 ).\n\nHowever, practitioners question whether Goodlatte’s successor as House Judiciary Committee chair will move the needle on federal remote sales tax legislation if the Supreme Court doesn’t take up the case. Many individuals, both inside and out of Congress, have singled out Goodlatte as the primary roadblock to e-commerce proposals expanding states’ taxing authority.\n\nJohn Buhl, media relations manager at the Tax Foundation, told Bloomberg Tax that the complexity of remote sales tax legislation will fuel congressional debate long after Goodlatte leaves the House, but a high court decision to pass over the South Dakota case could encourage Congress to act.\n\n“It’s more likely that South Dakota’s push to address this issue before the U.S. Supreme Court would prompt action. If the Court does take the case, Congress will need to step in at some point to ensure that there are guardrails in place to protect smaller online retailers from a slew of tricky state and local sales tax rules,” Buhl said in an email. “While Rep. Goodlatte has been a key player in the debate over remote sales tax legislation in Congress, this is a pretty complex issue.”\n\nHurdle in House\n\nMany have considered Goodlatte the biggest hurdle to passing e-commerce legislation, particularly former House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz’s Remote Transactions Parity Act of 2015 (H.R. 2775), which would have allowed states to collect tax from sellers without an in-state physical presence.\n\n“If what had been called the Chaffetz bill got a floor vote, it would pass the House and the Senate,” Joseph Bishop-Henchman, executive vice president at the Tax Foundation, told Bloomberg Tax. “The chairman did what chairmen do, which is kept it from coming to that vote. Lots of Republicans have said they support the bill but don’t want to cross the chairman, so who the next chairman is matters quite a lot.”\n\nJamie Yesnowitz, principal and state and local tax practice and National Tax Office leader at Grant Thornton LLP, told Bloomberg Tax that he believed Goodlatte to be a “major reason why the remote seller bills were blocked.” However, he expects “Congress to be wary of remote seller legislation until the U.S. Supreme Court comes to a decision on the Wayfair case.”\n\nTwo bills pending in Congress seek to undo Quill. Lawmakers presented in late April the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2017 (S.976) (MFA) and the Remote Transactions Parity Act of 2017 (H.R. 2193) (RTPA), in the Senate and House respectively, both allowing states to mandate out-of-state sellers and online vendors collect tax on in-state sales. Neither has received a floor vote.\n\nGoodlatte is a co-sponsor of the No Regulation Without Representation Act of 2017 (H.R. 2887) (NRRA), which would, in part, codify Quill. The NRRA received a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing in July, where a handful of members, including Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), ranking member on the subcommittee, voiced concern over the lack of consideration for the RTPA and MFA.\n\nGoodlatte was also behind the Online Sales Simplification Act, a proposed hybrid origin-based system that generally would base the taxation of remote purchases according to the seller’s location, but set the tax rate according to the consumer’s location. While discussion drafts were circulated, the measure was never formally introduced in the House.\n\nBishop-Henchman noted that while the next committee chair may or may not be enthusiastic about the RTPA, “they undoubtedly won’t be as enthusiastic about the hybrid origin approach that satisfied nobody.”\n\n‘Cement His Legacy’\n\nHowever, the congressman has nearly a year left on Capitol Hill, a period of time that won’t go to waste, Steve DelBianco, president and CEO of NetChoice, a Washington-based internet commerce trade association, told Bloomberg Tax.\n\n“There is still plenty of time for Goodlatte to cement his legacy as a thoughtful and principled leader, and I expect he will be central to the internet tax debate right through his last day in Congress,” DelBianco said, adding that “court consideration of Quill will remind everyone that the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.”\n\nDelBianco noted that due to GOP self-imposed term limits, Goodlatte would’ve relinquished his chairmanship at the close of the 115th Congress anyway.\n\nJeff Friedman, a tax partner at Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP, told Bloomberg Tax that he doesn’t think any particular congressman will lead to passage or failure of legislation. “Rather,” he said, “I remain hopeful that Congress will enact legislation that will provide a fair and simple tax jurisdiction standard.”\n\nFriedman also pointed to a Nov. 2 friend-of-the-court brief filed by congressional lawmakers urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accept South Dakota’s petition.\n\n“The amicus brief recently filed by members of Congress in the Wayfair case demonstrates their continued interest. Both political parties are seeking a solution,” he said. “While the composition of Congress will continue to evolve, I expect that Congress will show continued interest in sales tax legislation, remote workforce legislation and other legislation affecting state taxation.”\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Prete in Washington at rprete@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Cheryl Saenz at csaenz@bna.com\n\nCopyright © 2017 Tax Management Inc.

Last year California elementary school teacher Rebecca Friedrichs made the same First Amendment arguments at the high court against the teachers association to which she paid agency fees. The court deadlocked on Friedrichs’ complaint following the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, but his replacement, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is widely expected to cast a decisive vote in favor of Janus and against public-sector unions.\n\nA conservative U.S. Supreme Court may be preparing to drop a bomb on the country’s public sector unions, but California has heard it ticking for years. When the court agreed to hear Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31 , Joshua Pechthalt, president of the California Federation of Teachers (CFT), said his union and others in the state had already been working to absorb the blow. The case could strip public agency unions of much of their funding, and he admitted the effects on California’s labor movement could be devastating. Or, for some of the same reasons, they could be reinvigorating.\n\n“I think [Janus] is going to hurt, but it need not be the end of the world,” said Pechthalt. “Frankly, we’re going to have to do the kind of organizing that we should have been doing all these many years. I think the labor movement got a little bit complacent.”\n\nIn states like Wisconsin, Kentucky, Iowa and Michigan, where Republican state administrations have slashed union power in recent years, the Janus case looks to be a crippling blow in a national turn against unions. But California is going the other way, passing pro-union legislation such as a 2017 bill guaranteeing union access to government employees during job orientations. The Golden State is an exception in the national labor movement\'s fortunes, and Janus will put that status to the test.\n\nWhile non-union workers in a unionized department are not required to pay full union dues, under a unanimous 1977 U.S. Supreme Court case called Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, they must pay lesser fees to support contract bargaining, from which they benefit.\n\nIn a statement to Capital & Main, Diana Rickert of the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, which is representing Janus, wrote: “Today, Mark Janus and more than 5.5 million other government employees in America are forced to pay money to a union in order to keep their jobs . . . The First Amendment gives everyone the right to choose which organizations they will and won’t join or support financially.”\n\nMomentum for this argument has been building for years. In the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case Harris v. Quinn, the court ruled that homecare workers in Illinois did not have to pay agency fees because they were not truly public employees, and Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, basically invited more challenges to Abood.\n\nThe two organizations representing Janus, including the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, seem poised for a victory. Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pointed out the potential danger for organized labor, noting that from one-third to about one-half of all people represented by a union are not members of that union, and may choose not to pay agency fees.\n\n“If unions play things wonderfully, it will just make life more difficult for them. And if they don’t, it’ll just be a disaster,” Lichtenstein added.\n\nAnd so all eyes turn to California. Though it does not have the high percentages of union members found in New York, Alaska and a few other states, California’s labor movement has a reputation as the most innovative in the country.\n\nRuth Milkman, a labor expert at the City University of New York and a former longtime professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, points out that the state earned this reputation, paradoxically, by having a relatively backwater movement during the height of industrial unionization. With less heavy industry than states like Michigan, Ohio or Pennsylvania had earlier in the 20th century, the labor movement in California – and particularly the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU – would later focus sharply on organizing the service sector, with its hospital and government workers, and even the entertainment industry.\n\nWhen globalization shifted heavy manufacturing to Mexico, South America and Asia toward the end of the last century, gutting powerful unions like the United Auto Workers and the United Steelworkers, service unions were poised to grow and California knew better than anyone how to do it.\n\n“In the late 20th century and continuing into the new century, the SEIU became the engine of growth for organized labor,” said Milkman.\n\nPhoto: Alex Wong / Getty Images\n\nCalifornia is the place, Milkman notes, where new classes of workers are created. She points to the late-1990s SEIU campaign to recruit home health-care workers. They were categorized as independent contractors paid by Medi-Cal and thus not eligible for unionization, but the SEIU and others prevailed on the administration of Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislature and passed a 1999 law making these workers public employees and changing their eligibility. This precipitated what Milkman called the biggest National Labor Relations Board election in American history, adding that it brought nearly 100,000 homecare workers into the SEIU – a move that has since been replicated around the country, and then with publicly funded childcare workers, as well.\n\nSimilarly, California unions have a legacy of organizing immigrant labor, building off the pioneering efforts of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. This work is still evident in the SEIU’s Justice for Janitors campaign that began in the late 1980s and continues today. California unions have also been firmly behind the campaign for a $15 hourly minimum wage, which many see as a first step to organizing fast-food workers.\n\n“A lot of the success that [California unions have] had over the past two decades can be attributed to their success in the political arena, and that has created a more stable environment, particularly for public sector unionism, but also for unionism generally,” said John Logan, a labor historian at San Francisco State University. “While in the rest of the country, at the state level, there’s been a number of very brazen attacks on unionism, particularly after [Republican electoral gains in] 2010.”\n\nPost-Janus, California unions will certainly lose some of the money that gave them that political clout, but they still have the benefit of a pro-union state government.\n\nCalifornia bucks national trends by still creating quite a bit of pro-union legislation. Logan noted there have been proposals about changes to the right of fair representation, so that non-union members in a post- Janus era would have to either pay for the union to represent them in a grievance or have the option of hiring a private attorney. But California, like every other state, is restricted by the National Labor Relations Act, so there are only so many legislative responses possible. The principal response to Janus is a call for old-school grassroots organizing.\n\n“A number of our unions and our affiliates are using this as a time to go back to basics,” said Angie Wei, chief of staff at the California Labor Federation. “Which is one-on-one conversations, member-to-member, at the worksites. And building a permanent structure for the union … building power from the ground up.”\n\n“Some of the [agency fee] people have just never been talked to about the union and don’t understand it,” said Bob Schoonover, President of SEIU Local 721 in Southern California. Like the public in general, he said, these workers are largely unaware of union influence in matters beyond members’ wages and benefits. For instance, California unions are also solidly behind single-payer health care, and property tax reform and increased school budgets.\n\nSchoonover pointed out that his local was part of a health-care reorganization under the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles County, which brought public health, mental health and the hospital system under one umbrella, making it more efficient for everyone. This is how unions can demonstrate their importance to all working people.\n\n“The thing about a union, [like] the NRA or the Chamber of Commerce, is they’re there all the time,” said Nelson Lichtenstein. “In contrast to Democratic Party campaigns or Bernie Sanders rallies, they don’t go away. They have their people in there lobbying. That is important.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood is another one of these permanent institutions, Lichtenstein noted, but he added that progressives have very few others. The Right has more: mega-churches, business groups, phalanxes of think tanks. So both unions and Planned Parenthood are under attack all the time. “I link the two because both are kind of organizational, social institutions that are widespread and have constituencies. The Right understands that’s a threat.”\n\nThe CFT\'s Joshua Pechthalt said it’s a defining moment for labor. “This is sort of a new period of American history: When people don’t see a collective response as being valuable, or possible, they opt for individual answers,” he said. “We have to win people over to the fact that we’re stronger when we stick together in a union.”\n\nSeveral of the unions cited or quoted in this series are financial contributors to Capital & Main.', 'The Supreme Court Could Devastate Union Power In California', 0, 15),

That decision most likely will hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as the swing vote and who in the past has expressed his willingness to ban partisan gerrymandering if it can be quantified.\n\nHere\'s the real news. The state Supreme Court last week took control of the state lawsuit by granting an \"application for extraordinary relief\" filed by the plaintiffs.\n\nThe state Supreme Court reversed Commonwealth Court\'s decision to delay trial until the U.S. Supreme Court\'s Wisconsin ruling comes down, as Republican legislative leaders had requested. The Supreme Court ordered the Commonwealth Court to conduct all necessary pre-trial and trial proceedings and issue its findings of fact and conclusions of law no later than Dec. 31. The trial is scheduled to begin Dec. 11.\n\nThis decision enables the state Supreme Court to review the matter and make a determination in time for the 2018 election.\n\n\"We are very pleased that we are very much off to the races with the lawsuit,\" said Ben Geffen, a staff attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, which is representing the petitioners. \"We are very encouraged that we will be able to put on our case and get a final decision ... in time for a new plan to be put into effect for the 2018 primary.\"\n\nBecause this suit focuses on issues specific to Pennsylvania, Geffen told me our state Supreme Court will have the last word.\n\nIn the second piece of good legal news, the Legislature\'s Republican leaders were ordered last week to turn over documents related to development of that ridiculous 2011 congressional map, which a separate federal lawsuit filed last month argues has given the GOP an unconstitutional edge in elections.\n\nA federal judge in Philadelphia gave the leaders a week to produce communications they or aides had with the Redistricting Majority Project, or REDMAP, the party\'s spectacularly successful national redistricting effort after the 2010 census, as well as information used to develop the map. Republican leaders had fought the disclosure, citing legislative privilege, among other claims.\n\nThat federal case is scheduled for trial Dec. 4.

(The judge refused to allow any mention of unsupported allegations that Menendez solicited prostitutes during a Caribbean vacation.)\n\nInstead, what’s fascinating is that Menendez’s behavior is right on the razor’s edge between legal and illegal, at a time when the definition of “legal” is changing.\n\nI’m with the jury: Even after closely following the trial, I have no strong view on Menendez’s guilt or innocence, given the laws they have to work with. I do have a view, however, that the Supreme Court has been playing a shell game with corruption laws. It has stripped anti-corruption legislation of its power in two areas: campaign finance laws and anti-bribery laws. The public is left with few recourses against a growing threat of corruption. Whatever happens with this particular case, this is no way to do corruption law.\n\nThe essence of the charges against Menendez and the ophthalmologist Melgen boil down to this: Melgen gave Menendez a combination of personal favors, including flights and vacations, and political favors, including campaign contributions and those Super PAC contributions. In exchange, Menendez used the power of his office to serve Melgen in three different areas: He pushed for a Medicaid reimbursement policy change, he intervened in a dispute about enforcing a company’s contract for port security with the Dominican Republic, and he helped Melgen’s friends get visas.\n\nMelgen cared deeply about the Medicaid reimbursement because he was charged with overbilling under the policy, and he owned a 50 percent stake in the company involved in the port security dispute.\n\nWhatever happens with this particular case, this is no way to do corruption law\n\nThere is also a charge that Menendez violated the false statements law — the law, incidentally, that the former Trump policy adviser George Papadopoulos recently pleaded guilty to — when he signed his annual financial disclosure forms, filed with the Senate. He did not include gifts from Melgen.\n\nThe defense admits the ophthalmologist provided those flights and vacations, but says they were gifts from a friend and not part of any quid pro quo. They admit to the campaign and Super PAC contributions (hardly a secret in any case), but say they simply signify political support. The defense similarly admits Menendez pushed hard for the Medicaid and port security policy changes, but say Menendez believed in the policies he was pushing. He was influenced by Melgen as friend, not as a donor.\n\nA revolution in anti-corruption law\n\nThe case comes at a time when the law of corruption is undergoing a massive shift. That shift is the result of changing Supreme Court interpretations of the two main kinds of anti-corruption laws.\n\nThe first kind is prophylactic laws — those intended to make corruption less likely. These laws are like speed limits. We outlaw people driving at 90 mph not because all, or even most, of those drivers will kill someone. We do not think there is a deep moral difference between driving 65 or 72 mph on a clear, dry, sunny day on an empty highway. Rather, we think that a simple, clear ban on certain behavior will make death and injury far less likely, in general.\n\nIn the anti-corruption realm, such laws include campaign finance laws that create absolute limits how much corporations, labor unions, and foreign governments can spend. Such laws prohibit behavior not because it is per se corrupt, but because it is likely to lead to corruption.\n\nFor instance, foreign governments cannot donate something of value to candidates for office, period. We don’t care if there’s evidence that the candidate agreed to give the foreign government a favor: We care that there’s a risk. The advantage of prophylactic laws is that we need not engage in deep fact-finding about intentions, peering into the heart of a donor or senator who violates them. We simply ban the interaction.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been whittling away at corruption prevention laws\n\nOver the past decade, starting with a 2007 case, Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, and most prominently including Citizens United, the Roberts Court has been at war with these prophylactic laws — concluding that they are over-inclusive and that they chill free speech. In Wisconsin Right to Life, the Supreme Court struck down a section of the McCain-Feingold Act that limited the ability of corporations and unions to run TV ads. The provision said they could not fund broadcast ads costing more than $10,000 that mentioned a candidate for federal political office within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election.\n\nIt was a classic prophylactic rule, one with clear boundaries. Think of it as a speed limit.\n\nJustice Roberts, writing for the Court, said the rule infringed on free speech rights and didn’t precisely target corruption — because, he said, corruption only means quid pro quo deals, and there was no evidence of massive quid pro quos between corporations and candidates.\n\nThree years later, in Citizens United, the Court struck down yet another powerful prophylactic rule. The law had been that corporations and unions can’t spend unlimited money that directly advocated the election or defeat of a candidate. The Court again said that this law violated the First Amendment (because citizens have a right to hear corporate and union political speech). The Court said again that it didn’t target quid pro quo corruption precisely enough — because there was insufficient evidence that corporations and unions were engaged in explicit deals with candidates.\n\nCitizens United opened the floodgates, and allowed the creation of Super PACS — entities that take and spend unlimited corporate, union, and individual money, and advocate explicitly for the defeat or election of individual candidates.\n\nThe Menendez trial is a direct outgrowth of Citizens United. The activity that was banned before Citizens United is at the heart of one of the charges against Menendez. The hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to a Super PAC was the alleged quid for some of Menendez’s actions. Without Citizens United, this situation could not have occurred — nor a charge resulted — because the campaign vehicle of the Super PAC had been prohibited as a prophylactic.\n\nBribery laws have also been hollowed out\n\nHere’s what should madden you: In his decision in Citizens United, Justice Kennedy said that we should not worry corporate spending would lead to greater corruption, because bribery laws would still deal with our corruption problems. Then the Court went ahead and weakened bribery laws.\n\nThese laws include the Hobbs Act, mail and wire fraud, the Travel Act, and the federal bribery and gratuities statute. The Court has been extremely skeptical of juries’ decisions where such laws are concerned, has expressed the concern that enforcement of these laws chill normal political behavior, and has been very worried about prosecutorial overreach.\n\nWhen a trade association was convicted of illegal gratuities after giving the Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy tickets to the US Open tennis tournament, expensive luggage, and other gifts, the Court overturned the conviction — and preexisting law — because of an absence of a clear connection between the tickets and Espy’s favorable treatment of the trade association.\n\nThen in last year’s McDonnell decision, the Court overturned a jury verdict that found Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell guilty of bribery — and in doing so narrowed the scope of federal bribery laws. The basic structure of most bribery laws is that they prohibit a) giving/receiving a thing of value b) in exchange for c) a governmental action.\n\nMcDonnell took tens of thousands of dollars in gifts, including a Rolex watch; then he used his office to make calls to help his benefactor. There was no problem with the evidence that McDonnell took something of value, or that it he did it in exchange for something. However, the Court held that the jury had not been correctly instructed by the judge about the standards for what constitutes an “official act” — the pro in a quid pro quo.\n\nAn official act, the Court said, cannot be merely “arranging a meeting, contacting another public official, or hosting an event” without something “more.” Instead, the Court said, the government could only bring a case where there was evidence that the governor took the Rolex in exchange for McDonnell formally exercising governmental power, or attempting to do so.\n\nMcDonnell led to high-profile convictions being overturned — including those of former leaders of the New York state legislature Dean Skelos (R) and Sheldon Silver (D), and former Congress member William Jefferson (D-LA), who was caught with $90,000 in his freezer — most which will now be retried with new jury instructions. But it has also led to many other questions about the status laws that seek to punish bribery after it has occurred.\n\nFor instance, the defense lawyers in Menendez argued strenuously that a longstanding body of bribery law, “stream of benefits” bribery, was wiped out by McDonnell. “Stream of benefits” has been recognized by courts where the private party gives something of value to a public official, who then essentially agrees to help out as opportunities arise. The particular help isn’t specified beforehand. The illegal agreement is an exchange between a gift and a promise to help in the future.\n\nAccording to the defense team, this can’t be reconciled with McDonnell. The judge in the Menendez trial (rightly in my view) rejected the defense’s arguments, leaving for another day (and perhaps appeal) a full discussion of how the long-standing “stream of benefits” bribery squares with McDonnell.\n\nIn the Menendez case, there is proof that the senator sought specific governmental actions (changing Medicaid reimbursement policy, for instance), so the particulars of McDonnell are not really at issue here. The specter of McDonnell is here nonetheless, however: The case is tried in the shadow of a Supreme Court that repeatedly chipped away at criminal bribery laws, and seems overly concerned about protecting lawmakers, especially when engaged in activities that have become routine.\n\nFinally, the Menendez trial comes smack in the middle of a 25-year confusion about the correct jury instructions in cases in which the quid, the thing of value, is a political donation. The Supreme Court has said that more explicit promises are required when campaign contributions are involved, but has not been clear about just how explicit. The need to clarify this area of the law has taken on new urgency since the creation of Super PACs, and increasing numbers of Super PAC donors getting what they want.\n\nIt is fitting that the jury is hung. The Court has struck down so many laws that would make this case easier. If laws prohibiting Super PACs were still in place, we’d have no $600,000 donation. But in the very case enabling Super PACs, Citizens United, the Court suggested that bribery laws would be powerful tools to combat corruption threats — and then went ahead and weakened those laws.\n\nWhether or not you think Menendez is guilty, you may not want your senators getting the benefit of hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and then helping those contributors. And while we cannot peer into Menendez\'s heart, we know that other politicians have certainly befriended wealthy individuals who then go on to make Super PAC contributions — was it friendship? Was it corrupt? Or was it our fault for creating a system that encourages “friendships” that blur the line?\n\nZephyr Teachout is an associate law professor at Fordham Law School and author of Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin\'s Snuffbox to Citizens United (Harvard 2014).

Jones', '2017-11-15', 'Six of the 44 cases pending at the U.S. Supreme Court are about First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nThat includes Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al., v. Mansky, which was granted cert on Monday, Nov. 13. (See “Free speech dominates at U.S. Supreme Court,” Page 4)\n\n“When we started this case seven years ago, who would have thought [the case would end up at the Supreme Court],” said attorney Eric Kaardal, who represents the petitioners challenging a Minnesota statute restricting what people wear to vote. (See sidebar.) They want the Supreme Court to reverse the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said Minn. Stat. sec. 211B.11 is viewpoint-neutral and facially reasonable.\n\nFirst Amendment attorney Mark Anfinson thinks the petitioners are correct. “If I were a betting man, I know where my money would be, and that’s not on the Minnesota statute. I think that statute is of dubious constitutionality and I suspect that the reason the Supreme Court took it is because four justices agree with me.”\n\nThe petitioners are the Minnesota Voters Alliance, Andrew Cilek and Susan Jeffers. Cilek is the co-founder of Minnesota Voters Alliance. Jeffers is an election judge and former candidate for Ramsey County commissioner and governor. Kaardal is joined by the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, California.\n\nThe defendants are Ramsey County Elections Manager Joe Mansky, Hennepin County Elections manager Virginia Gelms, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, Ramsey County Attorney John Choi and Secretary of State Steve Simon. The amici curiae, to date, are Cato Institute et al., American Civil Rights Union et al. and the Center for Competitive Politics.\n\n‘Recognizable political views’\n\nIt started with the 2010 election, when the 2008 recount of the Norm Coleman-Al Franken race was still a sore spot. That’s when the kind of earnest enforcement of the statute at issue here began, Kaardal said. An Election Day policy said that the ban included not only campaign insignia but also issue-oriented insignia. It also included political apparel, which it said meant material promoting a group with recognizable political views. That encompassed Cilek’s North Star Tea Party Patriots T-shirt and a button he wore that said “Please I.D. Me.”\n\nThe suit was first brought shortly after the election, but the District Court dismissed the case. The 8th Circuit affirmed in part, upholding the dismissal of the facially unconstitutional claim, citing the government’s interest in peace, order and decorum at the polls. It remanded the as-applied claim. The petitioners requested a writ of certiorari, which was denied. The District Court granted summary judgment on the as-applied claim and last February, the 8th Circuit affirmed. The current petition for certiorari is limited to a facially unconstitutional claim and concerns only the Tea Party shirt, not the Please I.D. Me button.\n\nA split in the circuits\n\nThe petitioners noted that the Supreme Court’s 1992 opinion in Burson v. Freeman endorsed a ban on campaign-related speech at the polling place. Some courts have read Burson to ban all “political” speech and the court should clarify the boundaries between election law and the First Amendment, their petition continues.\n\nThe 8th Circuit relied on the D.C. Circuit’s 2001 opinion in Marlin v. D.C. Bd. of Elections and Ethics and the 5th Circuit’s opinion in Schirmer v. Edwards in 1993, the petitioners point out. But the 4th and 7th Circuits hold that a complete ban on political speech cannot be reconciled with the First Amendment, they continue. The 4th Circuit in North Carolina Right to Life v. Bartlett came down in 1999, and the 7th Circuit’s decision in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Barland in 2014, following Citizen’s United v. FEC from 2010.\n\nThe decision also conflicts with the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, including its 1987 opinion in Bd. of Airport Comm’rs. v. Jews for Jesus, Inc. where an ordinance banned all “First Amendment activities” at the airport, the petitioners assert. It was held unconstitutional because it created a virtual “First Amendment Free Zone” at LAX.\n\nFavorite T-shirt\n\nAt a press conference on Nov. 14, Cilek said he voted at St. Andrews Church in Eden Prairie. “Lo and behold, when I went to vote, immediately the election judge extended an invitation for the head election judge to come over. Like, we had a serious problem here. We had somebody that had a Tea Party T-shirt on trying to vote.”\n\nAfter twice being told he could not vote unless he took off his t-shirt, Cilek said, “That’s when the media got involved. And here we are seven years later, going to the United States Supreme Court.”\n\nCilek told Minnesota Lawyer he wore the T-shirt because it’s his favorite shirt and he likes to wear it. He also said, “This is an important free speech/First Amendment case. Several states have had issues with similar statutes. This has been in dispute for a long time. I’m grateful the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on this.”\n\nHe also said it would be “fantastic” if the case was resolved but he believes the respondents have “dug in their heels” and “want to protect this ridiculous policy. I ask myself, ‘Why would they fight this?’ I think people are interested in their careers. They don’t want to be seen as giving in.\n\n“If you showed 20 election judges various logos and T-shirts and asked them if they were allowed under the statute, you’d get 20 different answers,” Cilek said.\n\nKaardal agrees that it would be fantastic if the case settled. “I would hope we could agree, we should welcome voters and accept them as they are. If you want calm (voting practices), we need to get together across the table and do what’s reasonable. But the secretary of state and the election managers don’t want to do that.”\n\n‘Strong medicine’\n\nThe respondents say in their brief in opposition to the cert petition that the statute is a reasonable and viewpoint-neutral regulation of speech in a nonpublic forum. They also say that it does not involve the creation of a “speech-free zone,” nor does it involve a statute with substantial overbreadth. The overbreadth doctrine is “strong medicine” which courts use sparingly and as a last resort, the brief says.\n\nBecause a polling place is a nonpublic forum, the statute is subject only to a reasonableness test, respondents argue. The petitioners say the statute must pass strict scrutiny, whether or not the public forum designation is applied.\n\nThe law’s application to protected speech must be “substantial,” respondents further assert. The petitioners must demonstrate from the text of a statute and from actual fact that a substantial number of instances exist in which the statute cannot be applied constitutionally.\n\nRespondents also argue that the petitioners are “manufacturing” a circuit court split or a conflict with Citizens United v. FEC. The respondents distinguish the cases from the 4th and 7th circuits upon which the petitioners rely because they concerned campaign finance, and Citizens United concerned the general public dialogue around an election and was not limited to the interior of the polling place.\n\nPotentially disruptive activity\n\nDaniel Rogan of the Office of the Hennepin County Attorney said he was surprised that the Supreme Court took the case and that it had been relisted four times. Rogan represents Freeman and Gelms. The Ramsey County Attorney represents Choi and Mansky, and the attorney general’s office represents Simon.\n\nThe question is whether a law that has been in place since 1893, that is a reasonable restriction on the polling place and designed to allow voting free of political influence should be invalidated, Rogan said. It governs activity that is potentially disruptive, he said. “‘The Please I.D. Me’ button was designed to get people to do something the law didn’t require,” he noted.\n\nRogan is untroubled by the potential difficulty of drawing the correct line between what is prohibited and what is not. “The statute and policy have been around for more than 100 years, we haven’t had any issues. Election judges can determine what is political material. The Tea Party was a political organization that had recognizable views.”\n\nRogan continued, “This is a clash between the petitioners’ view of the breadth of the First Amendment and what we believe is the government’s role in protecting the right to vote. We’ve fought for this before and prevailed,” he said.\n\nLike this article? Gain access to all of our great content with a month-to-month subscription.

The Court ruled Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017, that while lawmakers have made progress, they are not on track to meet a court-imposed deadline to fully fund basic education, and will remain in contempt of court. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, file) The Associated Press\n\nBy RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The Washington Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that while lawmakers have made progress in a multiyear effort to fully fund basic education, they are not on track to meet next year\'s deadline and will remain in contempt of court.\n\nThe high court unanimously ruled that it will retain jurisdiction in the case, and gave lawmakers another legislative session to get the work done, ordering them to present a report by April 9 detailing the state\'s progress. The justices said that while a plan passed by the Legislature this past year was in compliance, the timeframe for full funding was not.\n\n\"The court\'s constitutional responsibility is to the schoolchildren of this state,\" the court wrote. \"We cannot erode that constitutional right by saying that the State is now \"close enough\" to constitutional.\"\n\nLawmakers needed a funded plan in place this year ahead of a Sept. 1, 2018 deadline. The Legislature went into overtime sessions this year far beyond their regularly scheduled 105-day session in order to approve a plan to increase spending on K-12 public schools that allocates billions in new spending over the next four years.\n\nThe biggest piece of the court order that the Legislature had to wrestle with was figuring out how much the state must provide for teacher salaries. School districts currently pay a big chunk of those salaries with local property-tax levies.\n\nThe plan that was ultimately signed into law relies largely on an increase to the statewide property tax that starts next year. The tax increases from $1.89 to $2.70 per $1,000 of assessed value, with the increase earmarked for education. The plan — which keeps in place local property tax levies but caps them beginning in 2019 at a lower level— will ultimately raise property taxes for some districts and lower them in others. Under the plan, the minimum starting salary for teachers will increase, with adjustment for inflation and regional differences.\n\nThe court took issue with the fact that under the plan, the salary component isn\'t fully funded until September 2019. It notes that the state would need about another $1 billion to fully pay for the salary portion of the plan.\n\n\"The program of basic education cannot be said to be \"fully implemented\" by September 1, 2018, when it puts off full funding of basic education salaries until the 2019-20 school year,\" the court wrote. \"If compliance by 2019-20 is close enough, why not 2020-21 or the following year?\"\n\nRepublican Sen. John Braun, this year\'s key budget writer in the Senate, said the later full implementation date resulted from the complexity of the changes made by the Legislature\n\n\"The court has clearly played a critical role in getting the attention of lawmakers and the public with its original ruling and continued oversight,\" Braun said in a statement. \"However, implementing historic funding increases that actually work across 295 school districts and reforming property-tax collections throughout 39 different counties forced us to develop this specific timeline.\"\n\nDemocratic House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan agreed, saying that the court \"missed the mark\" on that issue. He said that school districts need time to implement the new system \"otherwise the new money just goes into the old system.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to see is this thing jammed into place so quickly that it doesn\'t work or creates more problems than it fixes,\" he said. \"It\'s not just about funding, it\'s about the infrastructure to make it work.\"\n\nThe state has been in contempt of court since 2014 for lack of progress on satisfying a 2012 ruling that found that K-12 school funding was not adequate. Washington\'s Constitution states that it is the Legislature\'s \"paramount duty\" to fully fund the education system.\n\nLast month, attorneys for the state asked for that contempt order to be lifted, arguing that they had complied with the order ahead of the deadline. The court disagreed, and kept in place daily sanctions of $100,000 a day — that are supposed to be placed in a separate account to benefit basic education — that have been accruing since August 2015.\n\nIn its ruling, the court noted that lawmakers never actually established a separate account, though the state argued that that money — about $82 million as of Wednesday — has been ultimately used to pay for education.\n\nThe court wrote that \"it expects its directives to be obeyed.\"\n\n\"And since the court has ordered the payment of sanctions into a dedicated account, the State may not expend the funds in that account without the court\'s authorization, even if up to this point the State has kept only an accounting of the accumulating sanctions rather than actually establishing an account,\" the ruling read.\n\nThe court — acknowledging the Legislature\'s propensity for overtime sessions — emphasized that lawmakers must achieve compliance during the \"regular\" 60-day session that begins in January.\n\n\"If such measures are not enacted by the end of the regular session, the court will immediately address the need to impose additional remedial measures,\" the court wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Gov. Jay Inslee said he shared the court\'s frustration that the Legislature was not on track to meet the 2018 deadline, but said he was encouraged that \"the court recognized the incredible progress we\'ve made toward fully funding basic education.\"', 'Supreme Court: There\'s More Work to Do on Education Funding', -0.2, 11.9),

(Photo: David Zalubowski, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — When a Colorado \"cake artist\" who refuses to serve same-sex weddings brings his case to the Supreme Court next month, he\'ll have a tight-knit fraternity of florists, bakers and memory makers in his corner.\n\nThe group — ranging from a Kentucky designer of custom Christian T-shirts to Minnesota videographers who say their company exists to glorify God — has much at stake in Jack Phillips\' uphill crusade against his state\'s anti-discrimination law.\n\nOver the past five years, they have suffered a nearly unbroken string of defeats at the hands of human rights commissions and local, state and federal courts. Again and again, authorities have ruled that merchants offering goods and services to the public must serve all comers.\n\nThe losses have driven some same-sex marriage opponents out of business and cost others their standard of living and peace of mind. Their stories find little sympathy from the gay rights movement, whose leaders say the solution is simple: stop discriminating.\n\nBut the nation\'s highest court, closely divided since 2013 over same-sex marriage, offers the group potential salvation. Even a narrow ruling in favor of Phillips\' Masterpiece Cakeshop could extend to others who say their artistic creations deserve First Amendment protections.\n\nIt wasn\'t surprising, then, that the soft-spoken Phillips received two standing ovations last week at Colorado Christian University, just a few minutes from the bakery where he no longer sells wedding cakes while his case is pending.\n\n“The bottom line is that tolerance should be a two-way street,\" Phillips said to applause from students and supporters. \"If we care about a free Colorado and a free America, then we should all be for the constitutional principle that no one should be forced to speak or promote a message with which they disagree.”\n\nAmong those speaking at the rally was Barronelle Stutzman, owner of Arlene\'s Flowers in Richland, Wash., whose refusal to serve a customer\'s gay wedding brought lawsuits against her shop and herself from the state and the American Civil Liberties Union. Her case is pending at the Supreme Court until Phillips\' is decided.\n\n“We face losing everything we own — our retirement, our life savings, our business,\" Stutzman told the crowd. “If the government can come in and tell you what to say, what to think, what to believe, what to create, then we do not live in a free America.”\n\nMore: Free speech v. same-sex marriage case floods high court\n\nMore: Religious liberty battle still rages over gay marriage\n\nMore: One year after historic ruling, gay marriage win propels liberal causes\n\nDemonstrators celebrate outside the Supreme Court two years ago after the justices legalized same-sex marriage. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court has weighed in twice on the subject of same-sex marriage. In 2013, it ruled that the federal government must recognize gay and lesbian marriages in the 12 states that had legalized them. In 2015, it extended same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nBut even as he authored the court\'s landmark decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy held out an olive branch to religious conservatives.\n\n\"It must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned,\" he wrote. \"The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.\"\n\nSince then, the justices have tread carefully through a thicket of religious freedom cases. They told the Obama administration and religious nonprofits who objected to offering free coverage for contraceptives to settle their differences. They turned away a pharmacist who sought to avoid filling prescriptions for birth control because of religious objections. But in June, they ruled that religious institutions should be eligible to receive public funds for purely secular purposes such as renovating playgrounds.\n\nThe new case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and others like it focus more on religious believers\' free speech rights. The challengers say it\'s not about gays and lesbians but the sanctity of marriage. They point out that they also refuse other requests; Phillips, for instance, won\'t design cakes for Halloween.\n\nBlaine Adamson, the T-shirt printer who refused to design shirts for a gay pride parade in Kentucky, says he also has nixed shirts promoting strip clubs, portraying Jesus on a bucket of chicken, and proclaiming \"Homosexuality is a sin.\" He was charged with discrimination by the Lexington-Fayette human rights commission before winning twice in local and state courts. The case is now pending before the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n\n“Let’s never forget that our freedoms travel together,\" Adamson told Phillips\' supporters in Colorado last week. \"So if Jack’s forced to violate his conscience, it’s only a matter of time before I’m forced to violate mine.\"\n\nBut in Colorado, 20 other states and the District of Columbia, businesses open to the public must serve all customers regardless of sexual orientation, just as lunch counters of the 1960s had to serve African Americans.\n\n\"The anti-discrimination act does not tell the bakery how to design its cakes. It does not even require the bakery to make cakes at all,\" ACLU staff attorney Ria Tabacco Mar said at a moot court event this week. \"The law simply says that if the bakery chooses to offer a product to the public at large, it can\'t refuse to sell that same product to a customer simply because of her race, her religion, her sexual orientation or certain other aspects of her identity.\"\n\nCasualties among the resistance\n\nElaine Huguenin\'s refusal to photograph a same-sex wedding in New Mexico led to court defeats that the Supreme Court refused to reconsider.

Two years later, the couple shut the gallery for good.\n\n“We continued to be harassed until the day we closed and even after we closed,” Betty Odgaard, an artist, says. \"To be portrayed as hateful bigots and much, more worse was devastating.\"\n\nIn Gresham, Ore., Melissa and Aaron Klein\'s refusal to create a cake for a lesbian couple\'s wedding led to harassment against them and their vendors, so they closed Sweet Cakes by Melissa.

Their case is now pending before the state Court of Appeals.\n\n“Our lives were pretty much drastically changed,\" Melissa Klein says.\n\nEven winning in court hasn\'t done much to improve Adamson\'s situation, financially or otherwise. He lost about 25% of his business when the University of Kentucky and other major customers objected to his stance on the gay pride parade.\n\n“Before we even had a chance to respond, the damage was done,” Adamson says. “Once that’s out there, no matter what you say, you’ve kind of been tainted with this brush.”\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ijHoeu', 'Same-sex marriage foes stick together despite long odds', -0.1, 30.1),

Here is a preview of the fight ahead.\n\nOn Friday, a King County Superior Court judge will hear arguments on the legality of the income tax proposal approved by the Seattle City Council over the summer. The hearing is the first step in litigating the lawsuits filed against the City of Seattle that, if successful, could scuttle the attempts by activists and city leaders to introduce a more progressive tax structure.\n\nThe council’s ordinance, which would levy a 2.25 percent tax on individual incomes of more than $250,000 and household incomes of more than $500,000 and raise an estimated $140 million annually, garnered a rapid-fire filing of lawsuits to oppose its implementation; by August 30, a total of four lawsuits were filed by various Seattle residents—including local conservative businesswoman Faye Garneau.\n\nThe frenzied legal backlash was expected and is actually part of the plan. The Seattle City Council passed the income tax ordinance with the explicit intent of taking the matter to court. In a statement made shortly after the council unanimously approved the ordinance, then-Mayor Ed Murray said that Seattle was “challenging this state’s antiquated and unsustainable tax structure by passing a progressive income tax.” The city budgeted $250,000 to hire outside counsel to assist in the litigation process.\n\nThe complaints largely center on the same legal arguments: that the tax violates a state statute that bans local governments from levying taxes on “net income,” that Washington state Supreme Court rulings from the 1930’s deemed income taxes as unconstitutional, and that Seattle lacks explicit permission from both state statutes and the City Charter to enact an income tax.\n\nWith the legal briefs typed up and arguments solidified, Seattle Weekly checked in with attorneys representing both the defendant and the plaintiffs to get a preview of what’s to come.\n\n“We’re feeling good,” said Scott Edwards, an attorney from the Lane Powell law firm and lead counsel in the lawsuit representing Garneau (along with 19 other plaintiffs). “This is an unusual case because the City Council enacted a tax that they knew to be illegal so we expect the court to recognize the illegality of the tax after next Friday’s hearing. Cities don’t have plenary taxing authority; they only have whatever taxing authority the state legislature has granted to them. The city’s statutory authority to license for revenue does not extend to income tax. The tax is not authorized by the statutes that authorize cities to tax and to the contrary, it’s expressed prohibited by statute.\n\n“We believe that those arguments should be dispositive of the case,” Edwards added.\n\nIn the City of Seattle’s corner is Paul Lawrence, an attorney with Pacifica Law Group; Hugh Spitzer, a municipal government attorney at Foster Pepper law firm; and in-house staff from the City’s Law Department.\n\n“The overarching theme [of our argument] is that this is a tax that the city is authorized to impose,” Lawrence told Seattle Weekly.\n\nThis, said Lawrence, is because the ordinance taxes gross income and not net income (which is the type of income explicitly banned by state statutes). “We distinguish between what I as an individual resident take in versus what the entity I work for earns,” he said. “It looks at it from a personal income basis and we think that, in that context, we have a gross income tax and not a net income tax.”\n\nNaturally, Edwards disagrees. “It’s a fictitious argument that they concocted to avoid a statute that clearly prohibits what they did,” he said.\n\nLawrence said the city will also argue that the 1930’s Washington state Supreme Court ruling that income is property and, therefore, must be tasked uniformly (a position which is at odds with the basic premise of a graduated progressive income tax), relied on a faulty interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court case and was invalidated by Supreme Court rulings in other cases. “The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently rejected the characterization of an income tax as a property tax,” the brief filed by the attorneys representing the City reads, going on to cite Supreme Court cases from 1916 and 1939 to support their claim. Additionally, Lawrence argues that the state Supreme Court of the 1930’s incorrectly stated in their ruling that the majority of states and courts view income as property. “Washington’s treatment of an income tax as a property tax was and remains an outlier,” the brief states.\n\nHe added that state statutes grant local governments broad authority to levy taxes of all sorts for local purposes. “When you put all that together, the city does have authority to impose an income tax,” said Lawrence.\n\nEdwards argues that these arguments are largely irrelevant due to prohibitions in state law on income taxes. “None of that matters in the sense that they don’t have statutory authority to do what they did.”\n\nIn a preview of the kind of ontological wrangling we can expect from the case, Lawrence contends that the City’s income tax is actually a form of excise tax, which is allowed under state law, and that, more broadly, Seattle has “authority that the state legislature has granted to cities to excise the power to tax for all local purposes.”\n\nThis last argument is a new one from the City, and was not included among the arguments in the motion for summary judgement filed by the Seattle City Attorney’s office back in early October. Lawrence cites a specific statute that grants “code cities” (which is the classification of most Washington cities with their own municipal codes) that gives said cities “all powers of taxation for local purposes.” He then points to a related state law that extends this authority to all “first class charter cities” (i.e. cities with populations of more than 10,000 that have adopted city charters—like Seattle).\n\nThe King County Superior Court judge hearing the case, John R. Ruhl, will likely take a few weeks before issuing a ruling after Friday’s hearing. From there, regardless of the outcome, the ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the Washington state Supreme Court. “I would say that there is a certainty that it will be appealed,” said Lawrence.\n\n“The bottom line here is that the November 17 hearing is just the first step of a case that will go to the state Supreme Court,” he added.\n\nEdwards criticized the City for using the judiciary to push forward a local ordinance instead of lobbying the state legislature to change the statutes. “If they want to change the law, this is not the right way to go about doing it,” he said. “We live in a democracy. There are proper procedures for getting the law changed; you can go to the legislature, there are statewide referendum; that’s the right mechanism for amending state law. Engaging in an act that is clearly unlawful in order to try to get the court to change the law is simply inappropriate.”\n\nOn October 31, Councilmember Lisa Herbold (District 1–West Seattle) introduced an amendment to interim Mayor Tim Burgess’s proposed 2018 budget requesting that the budget office submit a report to the council by March 1, 2018, on possible uses for the revenue from the income tax. Still, the City will wait for the outcome of the four lawsuits before moving ahead with implementing the income tax. Director of the City Budget Office, Ben Noble, told Seattle Weekly that they are also holding off on hiring additional staff to oversee the tax.\n\nMeanwhile, activists in Port Townsend have been pushing for a similar income tax ordinance in the wake of events in Seattle.', 'Battle Lines Are Drawn in the Income Tax Court Fight', -0.2, 15.9),

The Senate Judiciary Committee held Willett’s hearing on November 15. People For the American Way sent the following letter to committee members to express our opposition to the Willett nomination. You can download this letter here.\n\nDear Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Committee Members:\n\nOn behalf of our hundreds of thousands of members across the United States, People For the American Way opposes the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. His record indicates a dangerously reactionary jurisprudence that would decimate the ability of the American people to impose reasonable limits on the power of large corporations. It also reflects a willingness to let his personal views shape his judicial decisions.\n\nIn the 2015 case of Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, the Texas Supreme Court struck down the state’s training requirements for licensure as a commercial eyebrow threader. Willett wrote a concurring opinion, contrasting state licensing requirements with “the American Dream and the unalienable human right to pursue happiness without curtsying to government on bended knee.” He argued that a commercial regulation affecting someone’s right to pursue a lawful calling should be presumed unconstitutional under the U.S. and Texas constitutions unless the government can justify it. Willett would allow judges to strike down regulations if they consider them “preposterous.”\n\nThis is a sharp departure from basic constitutional doctrine and raises the specter of the Lochner era, when Supreme Court justices imposed their economic views on society as constitutional requirements. For instance, in the Lochner case itself, the Court struck down a law setting a limit for bakeries on how many hours per day and week their hired bakers could work. Market forces had led to bakers being grossly overworked. But the Court ruled that the law protecting bakers violated the constitutional right of employers and employees to bargain with each other to establish an employment contract. By constitutionalizing this economic theory, the Court blocked people from acting through their government to protect themselves from the dangerous and sometimes fatal excesses of the free market. The Court eventually recognized its mistake and, by the 1940s, had thoroughly repudiated it. Willett would bring that view of the Constitution back to the federal judiciary at an especially inauspicious time and would accelerate our rising income inequality and falling public confidence in democracy.\n\nMoreover, it isn’t small businesspeople or their employees who would benefit from a constitutional prohibition against ordinary business regulations. To the contrary, it would benefit those whose power over everyone else is limited only by those economic regulations. Our history shows that companies do not protect their workers and ensure their products are safe out of the goodness of their hearts. In fact, they often do just the opposite unless there are regulations to prevent that.\n\nIndeed it is through our government that people who are individually powerless against an enormous corporation can establish “rules of the road” that rein in corporate power and protect all of us. It is the very essence of self-government.\n\nWillett’s hostility to this basic function of government appeared in a memo he wrote in 1998, when he was part of then-Gov. George W. Bush’s administration. He worked to dramatically revise a proclamation Bush was planning to issue honoring the Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women. Among other complaints, he breezily dismissed improving women’s working conditions as simply “more government” and therefore bad.\n\nBut his memo did more than reject the idea that the people can use government to remedy the harms that unfettered capitalism does to the less powerful members of society. As reported in the Austin American-Statesman in July of 2000, Willett repudiated the reality of workplace obstacles holding women back, as if they simply didn’t exist:\n\nI resist the proclamation’s talk of “glass ceilings,” pay equity (an allegation that some studies debunk), the need to place kids in the care of rented strangers, sexual discrimination/harassment, and the need generally for better “working conditions” for women (read: more government).\n\nHow could a federal circuit court judge issue sound rulings on Title VII sex discrimination cases when he “resists” the reality of how that discrimination manifests itself?\n\nJustice Willett has at times made it abundantly clear just how much his personal policy preferences affect his interpretations of the law. One glaring example was in 2008’s Coastal Oil & Gas v. Garza Energy Trust, a case about fracking, where his concurrence sounded more like a legislator’s floor speech than a judge’s legal analysis:\n\nAt a time of insatiable appetite for energy and harder-to-reach deposits–iron truths that contribute to $ 145 a barrel crude and $ 4 a gallon gasoline–Texas common law should not give traction to an action rooted in abstraction. Our fast-growing State confronts fast-growing energy needs, and Texas can ill afford its finite resources, or its law, to remain stuck in the ground. The Court today averts an improvident decision that, in terms of its real-world impact, would have been a legal dry hole, juris-imprudence that turned booms into busts and torrents into trickles. Scarcity exists, but above-ground supply obstacles also exist, and this Court shouldn’t be one of them. … I join today’s no-liability result and suggest another reason for [it]: Open-ended liability threatens to inflict grave and unmitigable harm, ensuring that much of our State’s undeveloped energy supplies would stay that way–undeveloped. Texas oil and gas law favors drilling wells, not drilling consumers. Amid soaring demand and sagging supply, Texas common law must accommodate cutting-edge technologies able to extract untold reserves from unconventional fields.\n\nParties litigating against a fracking plan in the Fifth Circuit could reasonably doubt getting a fair day in court before a panel with Judge Willett. The public would have similar doubts, which would serve only to erode confidence in our nation’s federal judiciary. And there is no reason to think this flaw would be limited to the one issue of fracking.\n\nIndeed, it isn’t. Less than four months ago, he used his position on the bench to do harm to married couples of the same sex, in flagrant violation of unambiguous Supreme Court precedent requiring states to give equal “rights, benefits, and responsibilities” to all married couples, regardless of the sex of the spouses. Sadly, the entire Texas Supreme Court was in agreement on defying Obergefell (perhaps not surprising for a deeply conservative state whose justices are elected in partisan elections).\n\nIn Pidgeon v. Turner, Willett and his colleagues addressed the constitutionality of Houston’s law giving city employees spousal benefits only for opposite-sex spouses. They ruled that while Obergefell required states to license marriages equally, it didn’t address equality of benefits. To justify their bizarre conclusion, Willett and the others posited that this was just one among many questions the marriage equality ruling didn’t address:\n\nAlready, the [U.S.] Supreme Court has taken one opportunity to address Obergefell’s impact on an issue it did not address in Obergefell, and there will undoubtedly be others. See Pavan [v. Smith and the pending Masterpiece Cakeshop case].\n\nPavan v. Smith was a summary reversal of an Arkansas court’s ruling upholding discriminatory rules for listing married parents on a birth certificate if they are of the same sex. No oral arguments were needed because Obergefell was unambiguous. But Willett used the U.S. Supreme Court’s forceful repudiation of another court’s defiance of the rule of law as encouragement for more defiance.\n\nAnd Masterpiece Cakeshop addresses legal issues not at all related to government recognition of marriages. It involves businesses claiming a First Amendment right not to comply with anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.\n\nIt is one thing for political figures to conflate state recognition of marriage with a private business’s compliance with anti-discrimination laws. But a judge who cannot tell the difference does not have the qualifications to sit on the Fifth Circuit. And if Willett does recognize the difference, then his decision to join the Texas marriage benefits opinion indicates a dangerous willingness to subordinate the rule of law to his personal feelings.\n\nFor all these reasons, we urge you to oppose the nomination.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarge Baker\n\nExecutive Vice President for Policy and Program', 'Letter: The Judiciary Committee Should Reject Don Willett\'s Nomination', 0, 24.5),

Spain wants to try Montano, a former colonel in El Salvador\'s armed forces, in the 1989 killings of the six priests, five of whom were Spanish. His transfer could occur at any time.\n\nThe State Department, which has final say over extraditions, signed a warrant in October allowing authorities to send Montano to Spain if the Supreme Court didn\'t step in, according to Montano\'s lawyer. Defense attorney Jay Todd told the court last month that \"if a stay is denied, the government can extradite Mr. Montano at any time.\"\n\nTodd didn\'t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Montano has denied involvement in the killings.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration\'s top Supreme Court lawyer, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, argued the extradition would promote good relations with an important ally against terrorism. Francisco\'s filing with the Supreme Court said lower courts have thoroughly considered and rejected Montano\'s arguments against extradition, including questions about evidence and objections to how Spanish \"terrorist murder\" charges against him were weighed by U.S. courts.\n\nCourt documents say Montano was among an inner circle of military officers accused of plotting to kill the priests, who were helping broker peace talks. The killings sparked international outrage.\n\nA federal magistrate judge in North Carolina ruled in 2016 that evidence presented by U.S. prosecutors showed Montano took part in the plot. Another federal judge subsequently agreed with the extradition, and a federal appeals court refused to block it.\n\nTodd argued in his Supreme Court appeal that lower courts didn\'t look closely enough at flaws in evidence used by Spanish authorities. Another question raised by Todd was whether the five priests maintained their Spanish citizenship. Todd has also cited the precarious health of Montano, a 76-year-old cancer survivor.\n\nMontano arrived in the U.S. in the early 2000s and worked at a candy factory near Boston. He was arrested in 2011 and sentenced to nearly two years for immigration fraud and perjury. He served that time in a federal prison in North Carolina, where his extradition case subsequently unfolded.

(YouTube screenshot/John Odean)\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday authorized the extradition of a former Salvadoran security minister wanted by the Spanish government in connection with the 1989 murder of six Catholic priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter during the Salvadoran civil war.\n\nInocente Orlando Montano Morales led El Salvador’s national police as vice minister for public security during the height of the Salvadoran civil war, during which the country’s fascist government struggled to suppress a dogged communist insurgency. El Salvador’s Catholic establishment, though generally wary of the communists, vigorously denounced the regime’s human rights abuses and attempted to act as mediator during the conflict. The Church’s denunciations precipitated a vicious repression, that frequently included state violence towards Catholic priests.\n\nAccording to a detailed report submitted to a federal court in North Carolina by Professor Terry Lynn Karl, a Stanford scholar who studies the Salvadoran conflict, Montano ordered and abetted extrajudicial killings, torture, and kidnappings, and played a substantive role in the slaying of six Catholic priests on the campus of the University of Central America. All of the priests were Jesuits, and five of them were Spanish nationals, prompting the Spanish government’s longstanding interest in the crime.\n\nSalvadoran soldiers dragged the Jesuits and two of their domestics into a courtyard in the middle of the night, and shot them in the back of the head, according to multiple accounts of the murder.\n\n“Colonel Montano conspired with other high-ranking officers to incite to kill and then murder six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her young daughter,” the report reads. “He then engaged with these officers in a campaign of lying and a systematic cover-up of the crime.”\n\nMontano fled to the United States after the war and secured provisional legal status. His status was later revoked when officials discovered he did not disclose his Salvadoran military service on an immigration application. He was charged and convicted of immigration fraud in 2012.\n\nThe Spanish government first sought extradition from the United States in 2014, in hopes they could try him for human rights violations. Montano fought the extradition through the federal courts, arguing there is not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for his arrest. Federal courts must first confirm there is a reasonable basis for criminal prosecution before approving an extradition.\n\nThe justices declined to intervene in the case after Montano’s efforts failed in lower federal courts. He can now be extradited to Spain at any time.\n\nAmong the other Catholic clerics murdered during the Salvadoran civil war was Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated as he said Mass at a hospital in San Salvador in 1980.

Inocente Orlando Montano — who had been the vice minister of Defense for Public Safety, overseeing the National Police, the Treasury Police, and the National Guard – be extradited to Spain to be tried.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco urged the Supreme Court to deny the Mantano’s rest for a stay of his extradition. Francisco wrote in a 29-page brief that granting Spain’s request for extradition “advances the United States’ foreign policy and law enforcement interests” and called Spain “an important partner of the United States in fighting terrorism.”\n\nMontano falsely stated on U.S. immigration papers that he had never been a member of the Salvadoran military and entered the country in 2002. Court documents say Montano was part of an inner circle of military officers accused of plotting to kill the priests, who were helping broker peace talks.\n\nHe asked the U.S. Supreme Court last month to stay his extradition, and the case is pending.\n\nMontano was arrested in 2013 for immigration fraud and perjury and served in a North Carolina prison, then appeared in a U.S. federal court after Spain – five of the murdered Jesuits were Spanish — sought his extradition to that country to be tried.\n\nFederal Magistrate Kimberly Swank of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina in Greeneville laid out in detail Montano’s role in the “terrorist murder” executions and ordered in February 2016 that be extradited to Spain for trial.\n\nSwank ruled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Justice and Accountability and the Spanish Association for Human Rights.\n\nIn August, U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyleof the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina upheld Swank’s ruling, saying a U.S.-Spain treat allows for the extradition.\n\nThe U.N.- Security Council-sponsored Truth Commission report found soldiers had shot with high-powered rfles Father Ignacio Ellacuria, 59, rector of the Central American University in San Salvador, four members of his faculty at the university and a fellow Jesuit priest outside the faculty member priests’ dorm on the morning of Nov. 16, 1989. The soliders then killed the only witnesses — the housekeeper and her 16-year-old daugher.\n\nMontano had served as a negotiator for the U.S.-backed, right-wing regime in El Salvador with the rebels in the country. Like 19 of 26 Salvadoran officers implicated in the killings, Montago had undergone training at the U.S. Army School for the Americas.\n\nDuring El Salvador’s civil war, more than 75,000 people died, and the war left more than 1 million homeless.

North Dakota, which finds that state governments cannot impose the collection of sales tax on retailers without a physical presence in the state.\n\nWhether the U.S. Supreme Court will consider the appeal is unknown.\n\nSouth Dakota is one of dozens of states that have mounted efforts to circumvent or challenge Quill, a decision that predates the internet boom. Those who support Quill say that it\'s unrealistic to expect out-of-state companies to navigate the complexities of state and local tax codes. However, the ability of online retailers to skirt state taxes and pass the savings to consumers is eroding the retail industry and state coffers, critics contend.\n\nThe ruling could impact the veterinary profession, which has long reviled the tax breaks internet retailers gained under Quill. Americans spent $28.23 billion on pet food and $14.71 billion on medications and pet supplies in 2016, according to the American Pet Products Association. Veterinarians often compete with online retailers, and the tax inequity is hurting their businesses, the AVMA stated in its amicus brief.\n\n\"The veterinarian-client-patient relationship, of course, cannot be supplanted by online sales,\" the AVMA wrote. \"But veterinarians still face showrooming with respect to their sales of pet products such as pet food, prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines, and flea and tick products in a more than $66.75 billion annual market for veterinary care and pet-related supplies. Consumers will avail themselves of the extensive training and education that make veterinarians and veterinary technicians extremely knowledgeable about these products, only to then make purchases through an online retailer that offers sales-tax savings.\"\n\nSouth Dakota’s governor estimates that as much as $50 million in uncollected state sales-tax revenue will be lost to online merchants this year. In May 2016, the state Legislature passed a law imposing sales tax obligations on internet companies doing more than $100,000 in business with South Dakotans. When online merchants Wayfair, Overstock, Newegg and Systemax failed to comply, South Dakota sued them. (Systemax was dropped from the lawsuit after it started remitting sales tax.)\n\nThe case reached the South Dakota Supreme Court, which ruled against the state. In an opinion published Sept. 13, the five-judge panel found South Dakota\'s new tax law to be in direct conflict with Quill.\n\n\"However persuasive the State’s arguments on the merits of revisiting the issue, Quill has not been overruled,\" the opinion stated. \"Quill remains the controlling precedent on the issue of Commerce Clause limitations on interstate collection of sales and use taxes. We are mindful of the Supreme Court’s directive to follow its precedent when it \'has direct application in a case\' and to leave to that Court \'the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\' \"', 'AVMA urges high court to end tax-free online sales', 0, 6.7),

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nSo concern among conservatives arose after Democrats swept to victory in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere this month, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in the November 2018 mid-term elections in which control over Congress is at stake.\n\nIf the party’s slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which reviews and confirms federal judicial nominees, is at risk, Republicans may need to move even more quickly on getting judges confirmed by the Senate for their lifetime posts, some legal experts said.\n\n“Obviously, who gets nominated and the pace of confirmations ... changes dramatically if the Senate were to flip back to the Democrats,” said John Malcolm, a former Justice Department lawyer and now an analyst at the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank in Washington.\n\nRepublicans “should be paying particular attention to pushing through as many nominees as they can,” added Malcolm, also active in the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers’ group whose members have frequently been tapped for judicial posts by Republican presidents.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans have not passed any major legislation since he took office in January despite controlling the White House and Congress. But after a slow start that had worried conservative activists, Republicans have made major headway on judicial appointments in recent weeks.\n\nThe Senate has now voted to confirm 14 Trump judicial nominees, including Donald Coggins on Thursday as a district judge in South Carolina. That includes Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch, eight others on regional appeals courts ranking just below the Supreme Court and five on trial courts. Obama had only seven confirmed at this point in his presidency.\n\nDemocrats, who accused Republicans of impeding nominations from Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, have said Republicans are trying to ram Trump’s nominees through the Senate, including some they say lack basic qualifications.\n\nConservative groups that just last month were criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the pace of confirmations are now applauding him.\n\nMcConnell, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, last year refused to act on Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, paving the way for Trump to restore the high court’s conservative majority with Gorsuch’s appointment.\n\n‘SIGNIFICANT LEGACY’\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump departs the U.S. Capitol after meeting with House Republicans ahead of their vote on the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" in Washington, U.S., November 16, 2017.

He inherited more than 100 vacancies when he took office, twice the number Obama inherited. The number has since climbed above 160.\n\nTrump generally has selected deeply conservative nominees, many in their 40s and 50s and able to serve for decades. He could name up to 30 percent of the federal bench in his first four-year term, said Leonard Leo, a Trump advisor on judicial nominations.\n\nHaving a more conservative judiciary could be pivotal on legal disputes involving presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, gay rights, litigation involving corporations and other matters.\n\nThe main impact of this infusion of conservative jurists will be to flip the ideological breakdown of several liberal-leaning federal appeals courts, said political scientist Sheldon Goldman, an expert in judicial selection at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nFederal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in Washington, often have the final say in major legal disputes because the Supreme Court hears only a small number of cases annually.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing for six Trump judicial nominees, Democrats said Republicans were acting on too many too quickly, preventing proper questioning of the candidates.\n\nTrump’s appointees may be more reliably conservative than those of previous Republican presidents. Goldman said nearly all have a connection to the Federalist Society, providing a “very consistent ideological vetting process.” Leo, the society’s executive vice president, helped compile a shortlist of Supreme Court nominees for Trump that included Gorsuch.\n\nJudges will be a focus of the society’s national convention that started on Thursday in Washington, with Trump selections including Gorsuch due to appear.\n\nWhile Republican lawmakers have been divided over legislation on issues including taxes and healthcare, judicial nominees are an issue on which tend to agree.\n\n“Fixing Obamacare is no easy task,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy group, “whereas the president has done such an excellent job of choosing nominees that it’s a no-brainer.”', 'Senate quickens pace of approving Trump judicial picks', 0, 7.6),

Five of the six slain priests were Spanish.\n\nMontano has been held in recent weeks by federal authorities in South Carolina.\n\nThe Trump administration had urged the U.S. Supreme Court to order Montano – who had been El Salvador’s vice minister of defense for public safety, overseeing the National Police, the Treasury Police, and the National Guard – be extradited to Spain for trial.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a 29-page brief that granting Spain’s request for extradition “advances the United States’ foreign policy and law enforcement interests” and called Spain “an important partner of the United States in fighting terrorism.”\n\nMontano was arrested in 2013 on immigration fraud and perjury charges and served time in a North Carolina prison. He appeared in a U.S. federal court after Spain sought his extradition to face trial.\n\nFederal Magistrate Kimberly Swank of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina in Greeneville laid out in detail Montano’s role in the “terrorist murder” executions and ordered in February 2016 that be extradited to Spain for trial.\n\nSwank ruled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Justice and Accountability and the Spanish Association for Human Rights.\n\nIn August, U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina upheld Swank’s ruling, saying a U.S.-Spain treaty allows for the extradition.\n\nThe U.N.- Security Council-sponsored Truth Commission report found soldiers had shot with high-powered rifles Father Ignacio Ellacuria, 59, rector of the Central American University in San Salvador, four members of his faculty and a fellow Jesuit priest outside the faculty member priests’ dorm on the morning of Nov. 16, 1989. The soliders then killed the only witnesses — the housekeeper and her 16-year-old daughter.\n\nMontano had served as a negotiator for the U.S.-backed, right-wing regime in El Salvador with the rebels in the country. Like 19 of 26 Salvadoran officers implicated in the killings, Montago had undergone training at the U.S. Army School for the Americas.\n\nDuring El Salvador’s civil war, more than 75,000 people died, and the war left more than 1 million homeless. A U.N.-led study found in 1993 that most of the killings came at the hands of right-wing death squads.', 'US moves to extradite ex-El Salvador military official accused of plotting slayings of Jesuit priests', -0.1, 4.3),

The court sits for a new portrait shortly after swearing in a new member. Time\n\nPresident Trump added five new names to his list of potential Supreme Court nominees on Friday. (Photo: Eric Thayer, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON – President Trump added five names Friday to his list of potential Supreme Court justices in a move that precedes the possible, but still unannounced, retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nThe biggest new name was that of Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Many Supreme Court justices have come from that circuit, and Kavanaugh tops the list of judges most often named as Trump\'s next pick.\n\nLike Justice Neil Gorsuch of Colorado, who was confirmed to the high court in April, Kavanaugh is a conservative who once clerked for the more moderate Kennedy. When Trump selected Gorsuch for the late Justice Antonin Scalia\'s empty seat, it was viewed as a move that might entice Kennedy, 81, to step down.\n\n\"The president remains deeply committed to identifying and selecting outstanding jurists in the mold of Justice Gorsuch,\" the White House said in a statement. \"These additions, like those on the original list released more than a year ago, were selected with input from respected conservative leaders.\"\n\nThe White House released the list on the second day of the conservative Federalist Society\'s annual meeting in the nation\'s capital, a confab that attracts many of the nation\'s leading conservative legal thinkers. It appeared to come out of the blue; no Supreme Court vacancies are known to be imminent.\n\n“There’s no inkling of any vacancy, but the fact of the matter is that you would be foolish to wait for one,” said Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society and a top adviser to the White House on judicial nominations. \"You never know when there will be a vacancy.”\n\nThe move also was a not-so-subtle signal to Trump’s core supporters that the president may still have the ability to deliver on his promise to nominate conservative justices. It comes amid ongoing confirmation battles over his lower court nominees.\n\nTrump has won confirmation of eight appellate judges in his first year, more than any president since Richard Nixon, despite nearly unanimous opposition from Democrats.\n\nAnother possible motive: Democrats have increased their likelihood of picking up a Senate seat in Alabama, where Republican Roy Moore is embroiled in a sexual harassment controversy. Republicans now have 52 votes in the Senate and would need at least 50 to confirm a new justice, with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Pence.\n\nThe other new names on Trump\'s list are Amy Coney Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor just confirmed last month to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit; Kevin Newsom, confirmed in August to a seat on the 11th Circuit court of appeals; Georgia Supreme Court Justice Britt Grant, a former state solicitor general; and Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Patrick Wyrick, also a former state solicitor general.\n\nAside from Kavanaugh, Barrett was the most notable addition to Trump\'s original list of 20 judges and one U.S. senator, Mike Lee. She drew sharp questions about her Catholic faith from Democrats during her confirmation hearings, prompting Republicans to complain about \"Catholic bigotry.\"\n\nKavanaugh was left off the original list of 21 in part because his jurisdiction is Washington, D.C., and Trump was elected as an outsider. When Trump\'s first two lists were released last year, totaling 21 names, they tilted heavily toward judges from \"red\" states, including many state Supreme Court judges with no federal court experience.\n\nOne name that remained missing from the president\'s new list of 25 is former U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement, another favorite of legal conservatives who worked in George W. Bush\'s administration and has been mentioned for years as a logical Supreme Court nominee for a Republican president.\n\nTrump\'s choices won instant acclaim from conservatives.\n\n\"These men and women have spent years in the trenches of state and federal government fighting for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" said Carrie Severino, general counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network. \"They represent a diverse range of backgrounds, including both state and federal judges, three who were former state solicitors general with first-hand experience protecting our constitutional balance of powers.”\n\nLiberals were not impressed.\n\n\"It’s obvious that any of these nominees, if they replaced Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court, would demolish large portions of his legacy,\" said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. \"Trump’s nominees all fit the same pattern: narrow-minded elitists who protect corporations and the wealthy over the rights of all Americans.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2irFhVX', 'Trump adds five names to list of potential Supreme Court justices', 0, 10.3),

Mansky. As part of its other laws protecting voters, Minnesota takes pains to ensure people are not harassed at polling places by banning people from wearing political clothing or accessories, or displaying campaign signs, within 100 feet of a polling place. Minnesota election officials read this broadly and prohibit not only material that favors a certain candidate, but also material that conveys a broader political message. MVA has been fighting the state of Minnesota over this since 2010.\n\nBack then, the head of MVA, Andrew Cilek, teed up this lawsuit by wearing to a polling place a “Don’t Tread on Me” t-shirt (which has long been recognized as a symbol of the Tea Party) and an “Election Integrity Watch” button that said “Please ID Me,” knowing full well he would be asked to remove them. The latter is something Cilek and company have been especially chagrined about: Minnesota voters soundly rejected a voter ID constitutional amendment in 2012, a measure groups like MVA had been pushing for several years.\n\nThe initial version of this MVA lawsuit was an as-applied challenge, meaning the organization was challenging the application of Minnesota’s law to Cilek’s t-shirt and badge specifically. The group sued the election managers of Minnesota’s two largest (and, not coincidentally, most diverse and most Democratic-leaning) counties and the Minnesota secretary of state. While Cilek argued that neither his badge nor his T-shirt were political or partisan in nature, lower courts shut that down, holding that everyone knew the “Don’t Tread on Me” T-shirt was affiliated with the Tea Party and the “Please ID Me” badge was designed “to falsely intimate to voters in line at the polls that photo identification is required in order to vote in Minnesota.” With that, the federal district court concluded back in 2011, MVA’s lawsuit failed because Minnesota had properly applied the law in telling Cilek he could not wear such material to the polls.\n\nAppreciate our work? Rewire is a non-profit independent media publication. Your tax-deductible contribution helps support our research, reporting, and analysis. DONATE NOW\n\nIn the latest development in this now-seven-year-old lawsuit, MVA brought what is known as an overbreadth challenge. This requires MVA to prove that Minnesota’s law is by definition invalid because it will be read in such an expansive way as to prohibit more speech than it says it will. Put another way, the group is saying that while Minnesota is attempting to restrict things like the “Please ID Me” badge, which courts have already said the state can do, Minnesota might also restrict far more speech. In its petition to the Supreme Court requesting the Court hear this case, it argued that Minnesota could ban red or blue t-shirts because those are associated with the two major political parties. However, Minnesota’s secretary of state and the election managers, in their filing, note that courts can’t generally invalidate a statute as overbroad simply because someone can imagine a far-fetched and narrow way the statute might be misapplied. Instead, a substantial number of possible applications of the statute must unconstitutionally restrict speech, which isn’t the case here.\n\nMVA lost this challenge at the federal district court level in 2014, and lost again at the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year. The Eighth Circuit found that a polling place is not, for free speech purposes, a public forum. In public forums—such as parks, sidewalks, and the town squares of bygone days—free speech is at its apex, and you can generally make whatever political speech or gestures you would like, short of making threats or inciting violence. In nonpublic forums like polling places, however, you can have restrictions if they are “viewpoint neutral” and “reasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.”\n\nThere’s two separate things at work there. A “viewpoint neutral” restriction means you can’t favor one type of speech over another. You can’t allow Democrats to wear Hillary Clinton gear to the polling places while keeping out the MAGA hats. You can’t say Tea Party pins are fine but MoveOn.org shirts aren’t.\n\nThat’s simple to agree upon. The real fight is over the notion of whether restriction on speech in the form of stickers, badges, shirts, posters, and signs is “reasonable” in light of a polling place’s purpose.\n\nThe purpose of a polling place is to ensure that all eligible voters get to exercise their franchise and vote. The Eighth Circuit pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court has long held that states have a legitimate interest in maintaining order and decorum in the polling place. They also have a compelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and undue influence. A button reading “Please ID Me” is designed to sow confusion. It’s designed to make people believe they have to provide identification or be turned away. It’s also designed to create divisiveness in a state where the citizens have resoundingly rejected the notion voters should provide the narrow forms of identification groups like MVA demand.\n\nIt isn’t a great sign that the Supreme Court decided to take this case. Indeed, there’s now a 5-4 conservative majority that is populated by people who are just fine with voter ID restrictions, such as Justices John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas, all of whom voted to uphold Indiana’s restrictive voter ID law. Though this case is not a voter ID case, it serves a similar purpose: scaring voters away from the polls. And the Court’s newest member, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has already shown himself to be sympathetic to increasing voting restrictions. A case that would allow a group of conservative voters to confuse potential voters by implying that they need identification, a case that would allow a group of anti-immigrant activists to wear shirts urging fellow voters to “build the wall”—that sort of thing is right up the conservative wing of the Court’s alley.\n\nThere’s a slight chance there would be a less nefarious reason the Supreme Court decided to take the case: There’s a circuit split. A circuit split occurs when some of the federal appellate courts in the United States decide things one way and others decide it the opposite. In this instance, the D.C. Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, and the Eighth Circuit all agree that polling places should be protected from partisan pressures. However, the Fourth and Seventh Circuit have ruled the other way. The Supreme Court is often compelled to weigh in to resolve these splits so that there is uniformity across the country. The possibility exists that the Court took the case in order to resolve that tension and would perhaps rule against MVA while resolving the issue, but given the composition of the Court, that seems unlikely.\n\nIt’s important to understand that this is all part of a long-range strategy for the Minnesota Voters Alliance and the attorneys that represent them, the Pacific Legal Foundation, to make voting much harder for people that are low-income, are people of color, are transient in their living situations, are re-enfranchised ex-felons, and more.\n\nIn 2012, MVA sued the state to try to restrict its same-day voting registration procedures. It argued that they are too lenient on possible felons and other ineligible voters and that there should be a blanket prohibition on certain people being able to vote. MVA’s lawyers also used the opportunity to talk about “ballot stuffing” and other buzzwords meant to convey that there was voter fraud in Minnesota.\n\nIn 2016, it directly challenged the state’s “felon challenge” statute. If your voting record notes you have been convicted of a felony, the election judge is required to ask you a series of questions to see if your rights have been restored and you are eligible to vote. People must answer under oath, and if their answers indicate they are eligible to vote, they are given a ballot. MVA wanted Minnesota to list all people convicted of felonies on voting rosters as categorically ineligible to vote. This ignores the fact that some may have had their voting rights restored in the interim. MVA even tried to get election judges to pledge they would engage in what they called “civil disobedience” and refuse to allow people to vote.\n\nEarlier this year, MVA demanded that the Minnesota secretary of state’s office provide it with data on all voters in Minnesota. The state gave MVA voter names, addresses, and voting history, because that is public information. The state refused to give MVA other information it requested, such as details on voting challenges.\n\nIt’s no accident that this broad swath of data is exactly what President Donald Trump’s sham “election integrity” commission has also requested. MVA has already been invited to speak to the commission at its December meeting, presumably because its members are clearly of like mind that voter fraud is rampant—and, by extension, that the franchise of voting must be radically curtailed instead of expanded.\n\nMVA has been trying to suppress the vote for years. A win for the organization in this most recent lawsuit would cement its right to use the polls to confuse and intimidate voters. A win would also bolster its ability to continue to undercut election freedoms in Minnesota, a state that works hard to ensure maximum voter participation. Now MVA has a champion of those efforts in the White House, and perhaps in the courts as well, and that’s bad for voting rights, bad for democracy, and bad for the United States.', 'A Conservative Group May Finally Get the Supreme Court\'s Help Suppressing the Vote in Minnesota', -0.1, 26.2),

It’s the most crucial case for LGBTQ rights since the legalization of marriage equality in 2015.\n\nBefore the Justices hear arguments on 5 December, here’s everything you need to know.\n\nThe Background\n\nIn July 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Denver to order a wedding cake. However, owner Jack Phillips refused on the basis of his religion.\n\nThe couple filed a complaint to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission based on the state’s public accommodation law. This anti-discrimination act prohibits Colorado businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nMasterpiece appealed the lawsuit, which found in favor of Craig and Mullins. However, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the original decision. They deemed making a cake part of Phillips’ business model and therefore not protected by freedom of expression or religion.\n\nAfter that, Masterpiece went higher and appealed to the Supreme Court and they agreed to hear it.\n\nThe Issues\n\nAt the heart of this case is the conflict between discrimination and the First Amendment’s freedom of speech and religion clauses. Does Colorado’s anti-discrimination law violate Phillips’ First Amendment rights?\n\nPhillips and his team are arguing the law discriminates against religion, especially since Craig and Mullins could obtain their cake elsewhere (which they did).\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission and ACLU, who represent Craig and Mullins, counter by arguing the law is aimed at business conduct, not speech. Furthermore, Masterpiece can also include language explaining their services do not endorse expressions of speech associated with it.\n\nThis is not the first time these issues have conflicted. In 2014, Oregon determined a bakery violated a lesbian couple’s rights when they refused to make them a cake. That same year, the Supreme Court found in favor of Hobby Lobby. They decided closely held corporations can have religious exemptions.\n\nThe Sides\n\nThe case has inspired passionate responses on both sides, from religious organizations to LGBTQ advocacy groups.\n\nThe Trump administration is siding with Masterpiece.\n\nCraig and Mullins also have their own support team beyond the Commission and ACLU. HRC filed briefs of support with various businesses and chefs, and Senator Tammy Baldwin also filed a brief.\n\nThe Consequences\n\nExperts say the judges will be divided on the case and Justice Kennedy may be the key vote. Previously, he wrote the majority decision for 2015’s Obergefell.\n\nIf the Justices find for Craig and Mullins, it will be an important step forward in protections for the LGBTQ community against discrimination.\n\nHowever, if they find for Masterpiece on the basis of the First Amendment, it could open the floodgates for legalized discrimination, even beyond the LGBTQ community.', 'Everything to know about the US Supreme Court\'s upcoming LGBTQ discrimination case', 0, 15.2),

The U.S. government recommended the Supreme Court hear the case, Animal Science Products v. Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical, to clarify how much weight U.S. courts should give to foreign sovereigns’ descriptions of their laws.\n\nLawyers for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce participated in a meeting in July with the Justice Department and other federal agencies to lobby against the Solicitor General’s recommendation for Supreme Court review, according to the ministry’s lead U.S. lawyer, Carter Phillips of Sidley Austin. The Chinese government previously told the U.S. State Department in an official diplomatic communication that it regards the exercise of U.S. jurisdiction in this case as an affront.\n\nThe ministry is not named as a defendant in the antitrust class action, in which U.S. vitamin C purchasers accuse several Chinese manufacturers and exporters of price fixing. But the Chinese government litigated vigorously as an amicus in the lower courts, contending that Chinese law compelled the actions of the vitamin cartel. According to the ministry, the vitamin C cartel was “a regulatory pricing regime mandated by the government of China.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Brian Cogan of Brooklyn nevertheless allowed the case to go to trial, ultimately entering a $147 million judgment against the defendants. The 2nd Circuit vacated the judgment in Sept. 2016. The appeals court said international comity requires deference to foreign sovereigns when their own law is at issue. If foreign governments have appeared in U.S. litigation and stated a reasonable interpretation of their laws, the 2nd Circuit said, U.S. courts are bound to defer to that interpretation.\n\nThe U.S. vitamin C purchasers, who are represented by Boies Schiller Flexner, petitioned for Supreme Court review on three grounds, including the appropriate degree of deference to a foreign government. According to the petition, the 2nd Circuit failed to account for significant evidence that the ministry\'s depiction of Chinese law has shifted in different tribunals.\n\nThe defendants’ lawyers at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati countered that the appeals court “cogently harmonized” precedent from the Supreme Court and other federal circuits – and repaired frayed relationships between the U.S. and China, to boot.\n\nThe Justice Department stayed out of the case at the trial court and the 2nd Circuit. In June, however, the Supreme Court asked the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the U.S. government.\n\nAs is typical, the Solicitor General’s office met with both sides to hear their arguments. The meetings were held back-to-back on July 24, and, according to Boies Schiller partner William Isaacson, included not just lawyers from the Justice Department but also representatives from a bevy of federal agencies, including the State Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. “Everyone who could possibly be affected was there,” he said.\n\nIn response to comity arguments from the defendants and the Chinese ministry, Boies Schiller pointed out that the Justice Department previously advocated against conclusory deference to foreign sovereigns’ interpretations of their laws in 2003’s McNab v. U.S., in which the U.S. government successfully opposed Supreme Court review of the conviction of a Honduran fisherman.\n\nJonathan Jacobson of Wilson Sonsini, who is counsel of record for members of the vitamin C cartel, said his side was disappointed the Justice Department ended up recommending the Supreme Court take the case. He said DOJ’s call for clarity on the standard of deference due to foreign governments seems to be legally – and not politically – motivated.\n\n“I do not believe this came from the White House,” Jacobson said. “There’s nothing in the brief to support the idea that this is an entire reset” of U.S. commercial relations with China, he said.\n\nIsaacson agreed the DOJ brief seems rooted in law, not politics. “I think they’re taking a position of great integrity about law enforcement,” he said. “The fact that they did this and recognized it is straight down the pike.” (The plaintiffs’ counsel of record at the Supreme Court is Boies Schiller partner Michael Gottlieb.)\n\nThe Justice Department’s recommendation probably increases the likelihood that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case, though it’s not a guarantee. If the justices grant the petition, Jacobson said, he is confident the Chinese Ministry of Commerce will appear as an amicus.\n\nI emailed the Justice Department and left a phone message at the SG’s office but didn’t immediately hear back.', 'DOJ bucks China, urges SCOTUS to hear case against vitamin cartel', 0, 6.4),

The lawyers thought that this plan represented an extreme gerrymander of the political map, so extreme that it was unconstitutional.\n\nI’ve lived in the 26th Assembly District since 1981, and before 2011, the 26th took in most of the City of Sheboygan. However, the 2011 redistricting plan “cracked” the city almost in half, moving the north half of the city into the 27th District, and extending the 26th south past Oostburg.\n\nThe end result of this statewide redistricting was Republican control of the Assembly—60 percent of the seats—even though they won slightly less than half of the popular vote in 2012.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on a number of partisan gerrymandering cases in the past, but has found it difficult to measure how much gerrymandering is allowed in a political process. Our case provided the test that the U.S. Supreme Court justices were looking for. When the Supreme Court scheduled oral argument on Oct. 3, 2017, I bought plane tickets.\n\nBuying airplane tickets to get to Washington DC is easy enough. It’s substantially harder to actually get into the very small Supreme Court courtroom. The key to getting in is to have a ticket, which, even for plaintiffs, can be hard.\n\nMy ticket strategy was to become a member of the U.S. Supreme Court Bar. It sounds prestigious, but mostly it involves paying a fee and finding another SCOTUS bar member to swear you’re not an ax murderer. However, being a SCOTUS bar member still didn’t guarantee admission. We were told to just be in line early.\n\nSo we were: 6:10 a.m., to be exact. I was with attorneys Wendy Sue Johnson (another plaintiff), Peter Earle, James Hall and Judge Joan Kessler. I was in excellent company for the long wait. It was still dark and cool when we got in line. I was very grateful that I had decided to wear sturdy, sensible, dull shoes. We were all just so excited, and by 8 a.m., really cold and tired.\n\nThe line for SCOTUS bar members began to move at 9:15 (the argument was scheduled to start at 10 a.m.). I got to the clerk’s desk, checked in and got my precious ticket, as did all the rest of us in our little group. The two lawyers after us got tickets as well, and then the clerk announced that all the tickets were gone! I couldn’t believe it. What if we had gotten in the line at 6:20 a.m.? I was so very intent in being in that courtroom that I don’t know what I would have done if I hadn’t gotten in.\n\nIt may have taken a long time, but I got a great seat, nearly in front. At precisely 10 a.m., a bell rang, the curtains parted, and the nine justices walked in and took their seats.\n\nThere they were. I’ve seen lots of photos, but the reality of all nine, just feet from me, was powerful.\n\nFrom my left to right: Kagen, Ginsburg, Alito, Kennedy, Roberts, Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, Gorsuch. My first thought was that Kennedy looked grumpy, Ginsburg looked very tiny, Kagen and Sotomayor looked open and interested. The arguments began.\n\nEach side’s attorney started with a prepared argument, but almost immediately, the justices interrupted and began their questions. Justice Kennedy started in less than a minute with the State’s attorney (the State lost at the District Court, so as the appellant, he went first) with a question that covered standing, First Amendment and Equal Protection claims. It was a big question!\n\nFor myself, I could hardly comprehend the questions, much less try to answer them in my head. Justice Breyer had a five part question (!) that I understand now that I’ve read the transcript of the hearing. But just listening to it was exacting. Of all the justices, however, Justice Breyer seemed to be having the best time, smiling broadly, and actually making the audience laugh from time to time.\n\nI also quickly found that what starts as a question can become more of statement of a Justice’s opinion.\n\nFor example, Justice Ginsburg asked, “I would like to ask you what’s really behind all of this. The precious right to vote, if you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?” She used the words, “precious right to vote” twice in her questions. I’ve admired Justice Ginsburg for many reasons and for a long time, but hearing her say this out loud was powerful.\n\nOur lawyer, Paul Smith, was next. This was his twentieth argument before the Court, and cheering for our side notwithstanding, he was very good. He got as many challenging questions as the State’s attorneys, but he was very skilled at bringing the Justices back to the central argument we were making--that this kind of extreme gerrymandering has real durability. He said to the Justices, “If you let this go, if you say…we’re not going to have a judicial remedy for this problem, in 2020, you’re going to have a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.”\n\nOther than Justice Thomas who did not speak, all of the justices asked challenging questions. They were clearly well prepared and had full command of the issues. It was an extremely intense, but respectful hour of argument and analysis. I’m not sure I’ve ever concentrated so fully for an hour as I did in that courtroom.\n\nAnd then it was done. Outside, I found myself standing next to Arnold Schwarzenegger at the impromptu press conference. His last words to the press were, “Hasta la vista to gerrymandering!”\n\nNo matter what the outcome, walking down the magnificent white marble steps of the courthouse, I felt I had lived a piece of history.\n\nMary Lynne Donohue is an alderperson for the City of Sheboygan with an extensive professional background in law.

Credit: Matt M. McKnight/Crosscut\n\nSeattle’s new income tax has always been headed toward the Washington Supreme Court. But to get there, it had to start somewhere.\n\nThat somewhere was King County Superior Court, where lawyers squared off Friday in a hearing on the city ordinance.\n\nOn the one side, defending the tax, were the City of Seattle and the Economic Opportunity Institute (EOI), a nonprofit. On the other were attorneys, including a former state Supreme Court justice and a former state attorney general, arguing the tax is simultaneously unconstitutional and expressly prohibited by Washington State Law.\n\nAt issue is a 2.25 percent tax on all income earned over $250,000 a year for an individual or $500,000 for a couple. In other words, an individual earning $300,000 would pay taxes on $50,000 of their income, or just over $1,000 a year.\n\nAt the time of its approval by the City Council last July, there were never any illusions that the ordinance would go unchallenged. In fact, it was explicitly sold as a means to get the Supreme Court to reconsider its 1930s ruling against any sort of graduated income tax.\n\nNevertheless, in oral arguments, the city’s lawyer, Paul Lawrence, begged Judge John Ruhl to allow the tax to go into effect starting 2018 in order to immediately start capturing that revenue, rather than wait for the Supreme Court, which could push everything matter by a year or more.\n\nSimilarly, attorney Matthew Davis — representing an investment manager, Michael Kunath, one of several plaintiffs opposing the tax — pleaded with Judge Ruhl to make an immediate ruling from the bench tossing the ordinance. The city’s argument, he said with considerable flair, was “legal malarkey.” And any hesitance to kill it would, he suggested, “send a message to the people that [the city’s and EOI’s] arguments had substance and it was a close call and this is not.”\n\nJudge Ruhl declined to issue a ruling Friday, promising he would before Thanksgiving.\n\nIn order to defend the lawsuit, Seattle and the EOI must successfully argue why the 1930s Supreme Court decision should not apply as well as explain away a 1984 state law forbidding taxes on “net income.”\n\nTo do so, Lawrence, an outside attorney hired by the City Attorney’s Office, and attorney Knoll Lowney, representing the EOI, leaned on what, to the outsider, could be seen as semantics: the definition of “net” income, whether the new ordinance was in fact an “income tax,” whether the 1984 ordinance was constitutional in the first place and the basis on which the Supreme Court’s 1930s decision stood.\n\nThe attorneys challenging the law — including former Washington Attorney General Rob McKenna and former Washington Supreme Court Judge Phil Talmadge — in some ways had the more straight-forward, even blunt argument: State law and the constitution are clear, as they have been for over 80 years, that an income tax is impermissible.\n\nArguing in favor of the city, Lawrence took the lead, attempting to pick apart the firewall against an income tax.\n\nFirst, he argued that the 1984 state law only applied to “net income,” not “total income.” An individual’s income, he argued, should be seen as “total,” while net income is a business term. The two, he said, should not be conflated. “By making that distinction, the Legislature was saying [a tax on individual] gross income is generally OK,” he said.\n\nSecond, Lawrence argued that the Supreme Court’s 1930s ruling that income is property, and thus protected by the state constitution from any kind of graduated taxation, should be tossed because that ruling was based on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that has since been overturned.\n\nAnd finally, he argued the income tax should be treated similarly to an excise tax, which is paid based on transfers of, for example, real estate from one owner to another.\n\nLowney of the EOI argued that the 1984 law’s tax provision should be ruled unconstitutional because, he argued, the clause on income was hidden inside “a nothing bill about a nothing topic,” specifically an obscure measure concerning the establishment of city-counties. Lawmakers at the time, he said, did not even debate the measure, proof that they didn’t know what they were approving.\n\nFor the challengers, their base argument was simple: The law says income cannot be taxed and so does the state constitution. Case closed.\n\nThe attorneys largely used their time to pick apart the arguments from Lawrence and Lowney. Before he was a Supreme Court justice, Talmadge was a state Senator and was among those who voted for the 1984 measure. He called the argument that prohibition on an income tax was hidden “spurious,” saying there had been hearings and lawmakers understood what they were doing. If debate was lacking, he argued, it was because “it was blatantly clear to every member of the Legislature that [an income tax] was unconstitutional.”\n\nAttorneys McKenna and Davis worked on the argument that the Washington Supreme Court ruling was based on U.S. Supreme Court arguments that have since been overturned. Again, their argument was blunt: It doesn’t matter what the federal courts have done; the Washington Supreme Court is its own entity.\n\nThe fact that the legislation passed by the City Council calls itself “an income tax on high-income residents” gave the plaintiffs ample ammunition to argue that it was not, in fact, an excise tax. The attorneys further argued that excise taxes were on voluntary activities, like opening a business, and earning income in Seattle was not voluntary.\n\nThe wonkiest argument was over this question of what is “net income,” which McKenna argued was essentially the same thing as “total income.”\n\nRegardless of which way the judge rules, the case will almost certainly go to the Supreme Court, where the more explosive potential lies. A King County Superior Court is not generally willing or able to overturn Supreme Court precedent; a Supreme Court, however, can.', 'In a warm-up for the real fight, lawyers argue about city income tax', -0.2, 14.5),

After taking office, Mr. Trump named Neil M. Gorsuch , a federal appellate judge who had been on his original list, to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, with little explanation, Mr. Trump added five names to the list.\n\nIf he again gets the chance to fill a vacancy on the nation’s highest court, Mr. Trump said that he would now consider two additional state judges, two newly minted federal appeals court judges and a veteran federal judge thought by many to be a leading contender despite being left off the president’s original list.\n\nJudge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was a striking omission from the president’s original list. One administration official has said in the past that Judge Kavanaugh would be a leading candidate should Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 81, decide to step down. Judge Kavanaugh is now officially on the list.\n\nOthers added on Friday were Justice Britt C. Grant of the Georgia Supreme Court; Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit; Justice Patrick R. Wyrick of the Oklahoma Supreme Court; and Judge Kevin C. Newsom of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.\n\nMr. Trump’s new candidates add to a roster of committed judicial conservatives compiled by Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump’s longtime election lawyer and now the White House counsel, with help from two leading conservative policy groups: the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.\n\n“If you’re going to be committed to picking from a list, it’s really important that the list remain current and complete,” said Leonard Leo, a top executive at the Federalist Society and an influential conservative who has closely advised Mr. Trump on judicial appointments.\n\nWhite House officials said the addition of the names was routine and was simply an effort to “refresh” a list that had not changed in more than a year. Even so, the announcement was a reminder of the advanced age of Justice Kennedy and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 84. If either one — or another justice — leaves the bench in the next three years, Mr. Trump will be in a position to pick a replacement.\n\nImage Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh is now officially on President Trump’s list of candidates to fill a possible Supreme Court vacancy. Credit via C-Span\n\n“These additions, like those on the original list released more than a year ago, were selected with input from respected conservative leaders,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe Federalist Society was holding its National Lawyers Convention this week in Washington, and the announcement from the president provided a bit of conservative legal buzz among the attendees.\n\nMr. McGahn addressed the group on Friday evening, and he named the five new candidates, saying they were committed conservative judges in the mold of Justice Scalia. Judge Kavanaugh received the most sustained applause.\n\nThat may have been part of the motivation for releasing the list on Friday. Several conservative groups issued statements praising the expanded roster of court prospects.\n\n“These are stellar additions to the existing list of Supreme Court potentials,” said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a leading libertarian think tank.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, 52, a White House lawyer for President George W. Bush and a former clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\n“The president is refreshing his list,” White House counsel Donald McGahn told an enthusiastic crowd at the Federalist Society convention at the Mayflower Hotel.\n\nKavanaugh’s name drew a loud response. “He’s winning on the applause meter,” McGahn said.\n\nIt was something of surprise that Kavanaugh was left off Trump’s lists last year. He had been seen as a strong candidate for the next Supreme Court vacancy in a Republican administration, particularly if Kennedy were to retire. But legal experts from the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society who helped draft the list chose then not to name any prominent Washington figures.\n\nBut last month, Kavanaugh took the side of the Trump administration in a dispute over whether a 17-year-old immigrant held in a refugee center could obtain an abortion. He wrote a 2-1 decision that put her abortion on hold for several days, but he was then overruled by the D.C. Circuit in a 6-3 decision. The young woman then had the abortion.\n\nAs for Barrett, the “the dogma lives loudly in her,” McGahn said jokingly. “A prominent Democrat suggested she couldn\'t be trusted because she is a practicing Catholic,” he added.\n\nHe was referring, if not entirely accurately, to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who questioned Barrett at her Senate hearing over whether she could separate her personal beliefs from her legal duties. Feinstein said at one point the “dogma lives” in her.\n\nBarrett, then a law professor, said she had written that all judges must be able to follow the law and set aside their personal views where there was conflict.\n\nThe other new names on Trump’s list were Judge Kevin Newsom, a former Alabama solicitor general who was recently confirmed to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta; Georgia Supreme Court Justice Britt Grant; and Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Patrick Wyrick.\n\nDuring last year’s presidential campaign, Trump pledged to appoint conservative judges and took the unusual step of issuing two lists of his top-10 contenders.

Radzinschi / ALM [/caption] The White House announced five new additions Friday to its list of potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, though no justice has announced retirement. The new names came in a late Friday press release that coincided with the annual conference of the Federalist Society, which has played a pivotal role in fashioning Trump’s list of potential nominees. The list include Justice Britt Grant of the Supreme Court of Georgia and Kevin Newsom of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The most notable national addition to the earlier list of 21 names was Brett Kavanaugh, a prominent judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Like new justice Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh is also a former law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Gorsuch was nominated to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, it was viewed as a gesture toward Kennedy, reassuring him that if he retired, President Donald Trump would replace him with simpatico, respected appeals judges. Kavanaugh’s entry on the list may serve the same purpose. Two of the potential new nominees—Amy Coney Barrett and Kevin Newsom—are newly minted judges who, if nominated soon to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, would have only brief experience as appellate judges on their resume. That is not unusual; both of President George H.W. Bush’s nominees, David Souter and Clarence Thomas, had only briefly sat on the First and D.C. Circuit, respectively, before being promoted to the high court. \"The inclusion of two more state justices—and only one from Washington (or anywhere in the Acela corridor)—also shows the national scope of the search for legal talent,\" Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said in a statement. The last justice to come directly from a state court was Sandra Day O’Connor, formerly an Arizona appeals judge, in 1981. A statement from the White House press office said Trump “will choose a nominee for a future Supreme Court vacancy, should one arise” from the newly updated list. Though rumors swirled earlier this year that Kennedy may retire, no justice has announced an upcoming retirement. Trump, as well as other conservatives, have also urged the 84-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire. She has said repeatedly she will remain on the court until she feels she is not able to do her job at “full steam.” The statement said Trump is “committed to identifying and selecting outstanding jurists in the mold” of Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed to the bench earlier this year. Here\'s a snapshot of the five new judges added to the list:\n\nAmy Coney Barrett was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit a little over two weeks ago.

Radzinschi / ALM [/caption] The White House announced five new additions Friday to its list of potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, though no justice has announced retirement. The new names came in a late Friday press release that coincided with the annual conference of the Federalist Society, which has played a pivotal role in fashioning Trump’s list of potential nominees. The most notable addition to the earlier list of 21 names was Brett Kavanaugh, a prominent judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Like new justice Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh is also a former law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Gorsuch was nominated to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, it was viewed as a gesture toward Kennedy, reassuring him that if he retired, President Donald Trump would replace him with simpatico, respected appeals judges. Kavanaugh’s entry on the list may serve the same purpose. Two of the potential new nominees—Amy Coney Barrett and Kevin Newsom—are newly minted judges who, if nominated soon to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, would have only brief experience as appellate judges on their resume. That is not unusual; both of President George H.W. Bush’s nominees, David Souter and Clarence Thomas, had only briefly sat on the First and D.C. Circuit, respectively, before being promoted to the high court. \"The inclusion of two more state justices—and only one from Washington (or anywhere in the Acela corridor)—also shows the national scope of the search for legal talent,\" Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said in a statement. The last justice to come directly from a state court was Sandra Day O’Connor, formerly an Arizona appeals judge, in 1981. A statement from the White House press office said Trump “will choose a nominee for a future Supreme Court vacancy, should one arise” from the newly updated list. Though rumors swirled earlier this year that Kennedy may retire, no justice has announced an upcoming retirement. Trump, as well as other conservatives, have also urged the 84-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire. She has said repeatedly she will remain on the court until she feels she is not able to do her job at “full steam.” The statement said Trump is “committed to identifying and selecting outstanding jurists in the mold” of Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed to the bench earlier this year. Here\'s a snapshot of the five new judges added to the list:\n\nAmy Coney Barrett was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit a little over two weeks ago. Prior to her confirmation, she was a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, her alma mater. She also clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, as well as Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Kavanaugh also spent time in private practice at Kirkland & Ellis, and spent a year in the Office of the Solicitor General from 1992 to 1993. A graduate of Yale Law School, he clerked for Kennedy on the high court as well as Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Judge Walter Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Kavanaugh\'s name was floated as a Supreme Court contender for would-be president Mitt Romney.

Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America’s independent news network.\n\nThe audience signaled with applause that it wants him to continue.\n\n“Maybe these questions are pretty popular after all,” Gorsuch said.\n\nTrump’s appointment of Gorsuch is among at least 150 achievements recorded in WND’s new list of accomplishments since Trump took office in January that form the basis for WND’s Thank Trump Card Campaign. The campaign, with a dedicated website, ThankTrump.us, allows people to send a personalized note of thanks to the president.\n\nThe Gorsuch appointment could be the first of several during Trump’s term in office.\n\nA writer for the left-wing website Alternet said during the 2016 election campaign that it’s likely the new president would nominate not only Scalia’s replacement but also an additional three new justices, arguing that since 1971, the average age of retirement for a Supreme Court justice has been just under 79 years.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg is 84, Anthony Kennedy is 81 and Stephen Breyer is 79\n\n“The new justices will set the direction of the Supreme Court and the values that guide it for the next generation. Scalia, after all, was on the court for 30 years before he died,” wrote David Morris.\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday is has added five new names to its list of possible Supreme Court nominees “in the mold of” Gorsuch, bringing the total to 25.\n\n“The president remains deeply committed to identifying and selecting outstanding jurists in the mold of Justice Gorsuch,” the White House said. “These additions, like those on the original list released more than a year ago, were selected with input from respected conservative leaders.”\n\nThe new names are Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Britt C. Grant of the Supreme Court of Georgia, Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kevin C. Newsom of Appeals Court for the Eleventh Circuit and Patrick Wyrick of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma.\n\nBarrett was grilled in September during confirmation hearings for her current judicial post by Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Dick Durbin of Illinois regarding her Roman Catholic beliefs on abortion. The now embattled Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., accused this week of sexual harassment, charged Barrett is unfit for the court because she gave a speech to a “hate group,” referring to the religious liberty law firm Alliance Defending Freedom as such.\n\nHistory of Republican high-court whiffs\n\nGorsuch’s affirmation of his fealty to originalism is significant because of the mixed record of Republican high-court appointments historically.\n\nRepublican President Dwight D. Eisenhower is famously reported to have said the two biggest mistakes of his presidency were appointing Earl Warren and William Brennan, leaders of the aggressively liberal court of the 1960s. The selection of David Souter by President George H.W. Bush is another example.\n\nOn the current court, the four Democratic-appointed justices — Ginsburg, Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor — have been consistently liberal on the bench.\n\nHowever, of Ronald Reagan’s three appointees — Sandra Day O’Connor, Scalia and Kennedy — only Scalia turned out to be a consistent conservative. George H.W. Bush scored with Clarence Thomas while getting burned by Souter. George W. Bush appointed Samuel A. Alito Jr. and John Roberts, who are part of the conservative wing of the court. But Roberts famously broke with the conservatives on the Obamacare mandate, casting the deciding vote to uphold the largest expansion of federal power in decades.\n\nMarc Thiessen, former chief speechwriter for George W. Bush, asked rhetorically in a 2012 Washington Post column why the Democratic record on Supreme Court appointments is so consistent while the Republican record is so mixed.\n\nHe said that for one, the legal and political culture pushes the court to the left.\n\n“Conservatives are pariahs if they vote against the left on certain issues. But if they cross over to vote with the left, they are hailed as statesmen. There is no penalty for voting left, but there is for voting right,” Thiessen wrote.\n\nAnother factor, he said, is that liberal Supreme Court nominees “can tell you precisely how they stand on key issues and still get confirmed.”\n\nIn her 1993 confirmation hearings, Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton, declared the right to abortion “central to a woman’s life, to her dignity” and was confirmed 96 to 3.\n\nBreyer, another Clinton appointee, declared abortion a “basic right” and was confirmed 87 to 9.\n\n“Imagine if a conservative nominee said the opposite? His or her confirmation battle would be a nuclear war,” Thiessen said.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Thiessen pointed out Roberts famously compared the role of a judge to that of a baseball umpire whose job “is to call balls and strikes.”\n\nGeorge W. Bush, he said, took that as a promise that “he’s not going to legislate from the bench.”\n\nBut when faced with a decision that could sink Obamacare, Roberts, Thiessen said, engaged in “the kind of sophistry we expect from liberals,” effectively redrafting the statute to make the mandate a tax in order to declare it constitutional.\n\nIn dissent, Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito wrote: “To say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it. … This carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the sophists.”\n\nThiessen observed that the left “sees the law as a tool of social justice — so they start with the desired outcome and then come up with legal reasoning to justify it.”\n\n“That is what Roberts did: He decided he wanted to uphold Obamacare and rewrote the statute to fit that outcome.”\n\nLike the reporting you see here?

He was politically conservative, and openly gay. Baffled by his stance, I argued intensely with him, holding him for so long that he regretted making such comments on his way to the bathroom. Recently, I told him what most attorneys like to hear: You were right.\n\nThis June, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The facts of the case are similar to the Oregon one: a same-sex couple tries to buy a custom-decorated wedding cake from a business owned by a Christian baker; they were refused based on the bakers’ religious beliefs. Both couples asked their states’ civil rights agencies to prosecute the offending bakers. Both prosecutions were upheld by state courts.\n\nCome December, though, Colorado baker Jack Phillips will have his day in the U.S. Supreme Court. According to Phillips’s petition asking the Court to hear his case, he built Masterpiece Cakeshop 24 years ago in Lakewood, Colorado, with his faith in mind. Utilizing his artistic background, Phillips marshals his time, energy and creative talents to decorate unique cakes that he believes can honor God.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPhillips has been a Christian for 35 years. He closes shop on Sundays, helps employees with personal needs outside of work and declines to make cakes with offensive, vulgar or profane messages.\n\nHe cordially refuses to make cakes that celebrate events or ideas that violate his beliefs, including Halloween (which costs him significant revenue), anti-American or anti-family themes like divorce, atheism, racism or indecency. On Nov. 8, at a freedom rally held in his hometown, a soft-spoken Phillips mentioned a time when he rebuffed a request for an anti-same-sex marriage cake, because it was hateful. In addition to not creating cakes with messages that go against his convictions, Phillips does not sell any products with alcohol.\n\nCharlie Craig and David Mullins visited Masterpiece on July 19, 2012, expecting to buy a wedding cake to celebrate their upcoming marriage. Phillips advised them that he would be happy to make and sell them any other baked goods. Craig and Mullins immediately left without discussing any details of their cake. The entire incident was about 20 seconds long.\n\nThe following day Craig’s mother, Deborah Munn, called Phillips, who said he doesn’t make wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious beliefs, and because Colorado law did not recognize same-sex marriage at the time. Despite obtaining a free wedding cake with a rainbow design from another bakery, Craig and Mullins filed a charge of discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Division under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), which prohibits businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation.\n\nAfter investigating, the Division issued a notice of determination, finding probable cause to credit the allegations of discrimination. Craig and Mullins then filed a formal complaint with the Office of Administrative Courts, alleging that Phillips had discriminated against them in a place of public accommodation because of their sexual orientation. The administrative law judge ruled in favor of Craig and Mullins.\n\nThe Colorado Civil Rights Commission issued a final cease and desist order, requiring Phillips to (1) take remedial measures, including comprehensive staff training and alteration to the company’s policies to ensure compliance with CADA; and (2) file quarterly compliance reports for two years describing the remedial measures taken to comply with CADA and documenting all patrons who are denied service and the reasons for the denial.\n\nPhillips appealed. He also refused to comply with the state’s orders, instead opting out of the wedding cake business altogether.\n\nThe Colorado appellate court cited a U.S. Supreme Court case, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (2006). There, a federal statute required law schools to allow military recruiters on to their campuses on an equal basis with nonmilitary recruiters. The law schools argued that by forcing them to treat nonmilitary and military recruiters alike, they were being forced to send the message that “they see nothing wrong with the military’s policies” regarding gays in the military. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying “that students ‘can appreciate the difference between speech a school sponsors and speech that the school permits because [they are] legally required to do so.’”\n\nThe Colorado court analogized: “it is unlikely that the public would view Masterpiece’s creation of a cake for a same-sex wedding celebration as an endorsement of that conduct. Rather, we conclude that a reasonable observer would understand that Masterpiece’s compliance with the law is not a reflection of its own beliefs.”\n\nHowever, an institution like a law school is inherently different from an individual, small business, whose policies and procedures are personally established and tailored. From Phillips’s perspective, he views his own action as an endorsement, and his work as part of his testimony to his God. Besides, Phillips was not requesting taxpayer subsidies, unlike the law schools.\n\nInterestingly, while the Masterpiece case was ongoing, the Colorado Commission found that three secular bakeries did not discriminate based on “creed” when they refused a Christian customer’s request for custom cakes that criticized same-sex marriages on religious grounds. The Commission reasoned that [like Phillips], (1) the bakeries declined the requests because they objected to the particular message of the cake, and (2) the bakeries were willing to create other items for Christians.\n\nThough I do not agree with Phillips’s actions, a pluralistic society that can tolerate differences should be able to respect the conscience of everyone, including Jack Phillips.\n\nJudith Kim is a legal researcher at the Independence Institute (@i2idotorg), a free market think tank in Denver.', 'Supreme Court\'s gay cake case is about a lack of religious tolerance', -0.1, 20.9),

Now he is political poison.\n\nEvery day seems to bring new evidence that Moore is not telling the truth, while his accusers appear to be.\n\nIf you have any lingering doubt, take the time to watch Monday’s on-camera interview by NBC of Leigh Corfman. She makes a powerful and compelling case that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a 14-year-old child.\n\nIf Moore has a conscience, he will do what is right – quit the race to be the next U.S. senator from Alabama. But he won’t do it, of course. His record shows that he rarely does the right thing. He is consistently self-absorbed and self-righteous – a man full of guile, but not an ounce of shame.\n\nSo Moore will surely stay in the race, but he should be repudiated by voters at the polls on Election Day, Dec. 12. His implausible denials and obstinate attitude only do damage to him and the Republican Party. It is his sad legacy, but richly deserved.\n\nLeigh Corfman Speaks Out\n\nMoore was a 32- year-old assistant district attorney when Corfman says she met him on a bench outside a courtroom. He allegedly lured her to his remote cabin, removed most of her clothing and molested her.\n\nPoised and articulate, Corfman conveys a persuasive account of how she was intimidated and frightened, saying she “didn’t deserve” to have an adult man “prey upon” her.\n\nWhen challenged as to why she waited nearly 40 years to divulge what she says happened, she explained that fear drove her silence to all but her family and a few friends.\n\nOver the years, Corfman said, she struggled with the notion of coming forward to confront Moore. On several occasions, she almost did. But always she worried about what a powerful man would do to her young children and her ability to support them financially.\n\nWhen Washington Post reporters recently sought her out, Corfman was reluctant to speak. Assured there were others who said they had been victimized by Moore and were willing to disclose their similar stories, she finally felt emboldened to tell her story.\n\nWhen told during the NBC interview that Moore denies he ever met her, she said quite simply, “I wonder how many ‘me’s’ he doesn’t know.”\n\nIt turns out there are eight other women who insist that Moore either sexually pursued, harassed or assaulted them. Their stories are all very specific as to time, place and manner of acts committed. The mothers of some of the women corroborate their accounts of creepy meetings with Moore when their daughters were teenagers – how he fawned over them.\n\nThese allegations are compelling. They have the ring of truth. Moore’s denials do not.\n\nRoy Moore Contradicts Himself\n\nMoore’s only interview in response to the accusations came Nov. 10 on Sean Hannity’s nationally syndicated radio show. The former judge did not acquit himself well. Since then, he has refused to be questioned, which can be revealing of a person who has much to hide.\n\nHannity posed tough questions in the style of a courtroom cross-examination. He first asked Moore if, as a 32-year-old man, he ever dated 17- or 18-year-old girls.\n\n\n\nMoore replied: “If I did, I’m not going to dispute anything.” This response sounds like a “yes.”\n\nBut Hannity persisted, asking the same question a second time, to which Moore replied differently: “I don’t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.” That’s a conditional “yes.”\n\nSince Moore’s answers appeared inconsistent, Hannity asked the question for a third time. In response, Moore adamantly denied ever dating teenagers when he was a 32-year old prosecutor. That’s a clear “no.”\n\nThere is a reason lawyers seize upon the conflicting or contradictory statements that people make. They suggest the person is not telling the truth.\n\nIndeed, there is a standard jury instruction in which jurors are told that if they find that a witness is deceptive in part of his testimony, they may conclude that the witness is deceptive in all of his statements.\n\nWhich account given by Moore was the truth and which accounts were lies? Was his first answer truthful, but the other two responses lies? Or was it some other combination? All three accounts cannot represent the truth, since they were all different.\n\nPeople who are incapable of getting their story straight tend to be lying. This is why cross-examination is often referred to as the “engine of truth.” When done effectively, it exposes all manner of prevarication and lies.\n\nMoore’s History of Lawlessness\n\nBefore the Alabama primary, I argued on air that it would be a serious mistake for Republicans to nominate Roy Moore. He has a long history of lawlessness.\n\nIf elected to be a U.S. senator, Moore would bring to the chamber his tempestuous personality and seditious approach to government. For his party and the Senate at large, he would prove to be destructive, not constructive.\n\nMoore was twice removed from his position on the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders on important constitutional issues, including his refusal to abide by a United States Supreme Court decision.\n\nIt is not within the legal province of state court judges to render the final word on the U.S. Constitution. Under the Supremacy Clause, such matters are decided by the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWe do not allow state judges to subvert federal law. In the seminal case of Ableman v. Booth (62 U.S. 506), the Supreme Court held that state court judges can never issue rulings that contradict the decisions of federal courts.\n\nYet either though ignorance of the law or insufferable arrogance, Moore has repeatedly attempted to usurp power and substitute his own judgment for that of the federal judiciary. He pretends to embrace the law. But in truth, he has shown nothing but contempt for the rule of law whenever it fails to conform to his own religiously driven interpretation.\n\nOn this basis alone, Roy Moore is not fit to serve in the United States Senate. The appalling accusations of sexual assault and harassment only reinforce that conclusion.', 'Gregg Jarrett: Roy Moore is not fit to serve in the US Senate and voters should reject him', -0.2, 24.2),

Consumers no longer have to pay for bogus intellectual property covering, say, a method to take their pills. The appeal board has rejected questionable patent claims over technology to clean up polluted groundwater and wastewater, over podcasting, and over a system that Los Angeles wanted to introduce that looks a lot like E-ZPass.\n\n“It probably hasn’t made patent trolls go away, but it’s changed their demands,” noted Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University. “Now they sue and ask for $50,000 rather than sue and ask for $1 million.”\n\nAfter years of aggressive intellectual-property claims, experts argue that the new panel is helping to push patent law in a much-needed direction: to relax its stifling effects on the economy.\n\n“At a high level, we have made an impressive amount of progress over the last five to 10 years in getting the patent system more into balance,” said Carl Shapiro, an expert on competition policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nBut for all the benefits of culling faulty intellectual-property rights, the board is under existential threat. Next week, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge that the Patent Office’s new procedure is unconstitutional because invalidating a patent amounts to an unlawful takeover of private property.\n\nThe accusers in the case, Oil States Energy Services v. Greene’s Energy Group, argue that taking private property is something only a court — not a government agency like the Patent Office — can do.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how the Supreme Court will rule. Patents are not standard-issue private property, like a plot of land. They are granted by the government to encourage innovation, a public good, because inventors might not invent without a period of exclusivity over the fruits of their idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond the constitutional questions, I would suggest to the justices on the court that they consider the ramifications of their decision on the United States economy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

Striking down a bad patent is less about confiscating property than about discovering that the property right should not have been awarded in the first place.\n\nStringent intellectual property laws seem to be doing little to encourage real innovation and entrepreneurship. Indeed, an increasingly robust body of research finds that the gradual strengthening of patents has hindered innovation rather than foster it.\n\nThe patents Teva was trying to uphold, which the Patent Office tribunal shot down, were designed not to establish its exclusive rights over a new technology but to prolong its exclusive rights to an old one. Its case is not unusual: Researchers are finding that more and more pharmaceutical companies are recycling and repurposing old medicines rather than inventing new ones.\n\nResearchers at the University of California Hastings College of the Law found that three-quarters of the drugs associated with new patents in the records of the Food and Drug Administration were not new drugs coming on the market, but existing drugs. Pharmaceutical companies extended their exclusivity over blockbuster drugs 80 percent of the time, attaching new patents on dosage and other aspects that had nothing to do with the original invention.\n\nHere’s how it works: Pharmaceutical companies start moving doctors to the tweaked formulation before the initial patent runs out, so that by the time it expires nobody is prescribing the original drug. That gives them an extra 20 years of exclusivity in which they can charge patients and their insurance companies exorbitant fees. Society has nothing to gain.\n\nIn a brief to the court, the Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge — a nonprofit group arguing for broader access to affordable medicines — argued that the Patent Office’s panel “is an important and necessary tool in the fight to lower drug prices because it allows the timely removal of unmerited patents, which promotes competition.”\n\nTahir Amin, a co-executive director of the initiative, added that “there are a lot of patent trolls trying to extort rents from low-quality patents.”\n\nThe Supreme Court has in recent years shown itself sympathetic to the argument that patent protections have become too restrictive. On half a dozen occasions since 2013, it has overturned decisions by Federal District Courts granting patent rights over what were ultimately fairly intuitive processes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNotably, the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International held that where a patent claim is based on an abstract idea, which is not patentable, using generic computer implementation does not transform that idea into a patentable invention.\n\nCorporate interests are not aligned in this case, though. Pharmaceutical companies despise the Patent Office’s new powers. Information-technology corporations, which incorporate thousands of ideas into one gadget and see themselves as victims of patent trolls, are strong supporters of this relatively cheap and expedient avenue to challenge patents once they have been written.\n\nThe Goliaths of technology are, of course, out for themselves alone. Yet in this case they are aligned with the economy’s interest. For too long, innovation has been narrowed to fit patent holders’ argument for sacrosanct property rights.

Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, refused to make a wedding cake for the Denver-based couple on the basis that it would violate his religious beliefs as a Christian.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Washington Blade, Craig, 37, and Mullins, 33, said they’ve been anticipating the oral arguments in the case — set for Dec. 5 — with intense emotions.\n\nMullins said he’s been filled with “trepidation and excitement” since the Supreme Court agreed to hear the lawsuit in June.\n\n“I will definitely say I don’t think anyone in the country is prepared to hear that a case they are party to is going to be argued before the Supreme Court,” Mullins said. “That was definitely a hard thing for us to wrap our minds around.”\n\nThe day of oral arguments for the court on Dec. 5 is actually the anniversary for the first date of the couple seven years ago. (Recognizing the occasion, Craig said “maybe it’s good luck.”)\n\nCraig said the two met through a mutual best friend and were friends for a good year before dating. At a time when same-sex marriage was legal in limited places and not in their home state of Colorado, the two nonetheless decided to marry.\n\nAlthough many couples arrange dramatic engagement proposals, Mullins said the couple had a “cute story” that wasn’t very dramatic.\n\n“In all reality, we were just lying on the couch together one Sunday morning,” Mullins said. “I think it was Charlie who turned me. He was like, ‘You know. I really would marry you.’ And I thought about it and I was like, ‘I would marry you, too.’ And we sort of sat there for a minute and we were like, ‘So should we get married? And we decided to get married.’ It was a very natural, casual moment, which was really kind of how our relationship was.”\n\nCraig added he later discovered Mullins had been socking away money to buy wedding rings. (The two have a pair of three-diamond rings. Craig’s is made of white gold, but Mullins’s is comprised of cobalt because he’s allergic to silver and gold.)\n\nBecause same-sex marriage wasn’t yet legal in Colorado, the couple decided to marry in Provincetown, Mass. The Bay State, first in the country with marriage equality, legalized same-sex marriage as a result of a court order by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 2003.\n\nThe two planned to have 30 friends and family members fly up to Massachusetts for the ceremony, and have a hometown reception in Colorado. But then there was the matter of the wedding cake.\n\nCraig said the host for the Denver reception party used Masterpiece Cakeshop for earlier clients and recommended the bakery based on its service and close proximity.\n\n“We looked up the website and were like, yeah, OK, they look like something that we would want,” Craig said.\n\nOn the fateful day, July 19, 2012, Mullins and Craig proceeded to Masterpiece Cakeshop and brought along Craig’s mother. Because she doesn’t live in Denver and was in town for a conference that day, the wedding cake purchase would be her only opportunity to take part in the planning.\n\nMullins said the three went in “really excited” and Craig came in with a binder of ideas, but “it all went wrong immediately” after they sat down with Phillips.\n\n“He immediately asked us who the cake was for and we said it was for us, and he told us he would not make a cake for a same-sex wedding,” Mullins said. “And what followed was a horrible pregnant pause. We were just mortified and embarrassed and quickly we just got up and we left.”\n\nWhen the couple entered the parking lot, Mullins said they became emotional and broke down in tears — a moment they said was all the more “painful and profoundly embarrassing” because Craig’s mother was present.\n\nThe couple said they had no idea Phillips sought to operate his business consistent with this Christian beliefs, nor that he had a policy of refusing wedding cakes to same-sex couples.\n\nCraig and Mullins quickly found relief from the LGBT community and supporters after a Facebook post, which quickly went viral worldwide in a couple days.\n\nAs a result of the Facebook post, a friend informed the couple that Phillips’ actions were a violation of state law in Colorado — something Mullins said the couple wasn’t aware of previously.\n\n“We actually were unaware that there was a law in Colorado against what happened,” Mullins said. “It actually took a relative of Charlie’s looking something up and connecting us the next day to actually tell us there was an anti-discrimination statute in Colorado that covered public accommodations discrimination.”\n\nAnother Colorado shop, Lora’s Donuts & Bakery Shop, offered to provide the wedding cake the couple ultimately used for their celebration. The cake had rainbow layering to represent solidarity with the LGBT community.\n\nBut there still was the matter of the discrimination. Mullins said the couple spoke with the LGBT legal group Lambda Legal about their rights under state law, then the American Civil Liberties Union — which represents them in the case — helped them further and filed a complaint on their behalf in 2013.\n\n“Eventually, someone at the ACLU found us and we spoke to them, and we decided to move forward with the complaint,” Mullins said. “They sort of helped us file the paperwork a little bit, and then after that and much discussion on their part, they decided to take up the case.”\n\nPrior to the complaint, the couple hadn’t had significant experience in LGBT advocacy. Craig, an alumnus of University of Wyoming in Laramie, said 15 years ago he was a board member of a student LGBT group that sought to raise awareness for the Matthew Shepard Foundation and HIV testing, and Mullins said he couldn’t recall any instance of prior LGBT work.\n\n“This was kind of my awakening,” Mullins said.\n\nJames Esseks, director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project, said by filing a complaint, the couple took the lead in the fight to ensure equal rights for LGBT people.\n\n“No one should ever have to experience the kind of pain and humiliation that Charlie and Dave were put through,” Esseks said. “They’ve shown real courage to stand up for the rights of all of us and we’re proud to stand with them as they take this fight to the Supreme Court. We all deserve the freedom to go out in public without being turned away because of who we are.”\n\nAt the state level, the couple had success many times over. In December 2013, an administrative judge ruled the bakery had illegally discriminated against the couple — a decision affirmed by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop wasn’t penalized with monetary damages, but required to take remedial measures to comply with the law, institute comprehensive staff training and issue quarterly compliance reports for two years on these corrections in addition to documenting all patrons denied service at the bakery.\n\nMullins said the litigation “is not about whether or not there’s somewhere else we could get a cake” when asked why the couple is insistent Masterpiece Cakeshop be required to serve wedding cakes to same-sex couples.\n\n“Our case is about basic access to public accommodations,” Mullins added. “We were not turned away from Masterpiece Cakeshop because of any design we asked for, we were turned away because we’re a gay couple, and we pursued this because we didn’t want another couple to go through what we had gone through.”\n\nMullins said if Masterpiece Cakeshop followed state law “we would have received the same service that any other person would have received, we would have been treated with respect.”\n\nAs litigation proceeded, Craig said the couple discovered Masterpiece Cakeshop turned away four or five same-sex couples before them. Although court documents say Phillips had offered the couple any ready-made product in the store in lieu of a wedding cake, Craig said one of these couples had sought cupcakes and were denied service.\n\nIn 2015, a three-judge panel on the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the commission. Later, the Colorado Supreme Court refused to hear the case upon appeal from Masterpiece Cakeshop.\n\nThat seemed like the end of the road for Masterpiece Cakeshop, But in a last ditch effort, the bakery, represented by the anti-LGBT legal firm Alliance Defending Freedom, petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review, citing issues of freedom of religion and expression.\n\nTo the surprise of just about everyone, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to accept the petition in June. (The petition had remained pending before the Supreme Court for some time and was taken up shortly after confirmation to the bench of U.S. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch.)\n\nWhy did the Supreme Court agree to take up the case? After consistent rulings at the state level in favor of the couple, could justices have in mind overturning those decisions in favor of allowing anti-LGBT discrimination?\n\nThe answer, Mullins said, is completely in the minds of the Supreme Court justices and no one else — at least until justices render their decision in the case.\n\n“Obviously there have been numerous public accommodations cases that have happened in numerous states, and in my wholly un-legal opinion, I think that maybe the reason they took our case was because there was no disagreement over the facts of how anything went down,” Mullins said. “It’s also possible that they just felt it was time to take up one and ours was the one that was on their desk when they made that decision.”\n\nMullins and Craig — with Craig’s mother in tow — plan to travel to D.C. to witness the oral arguments firsthand at the Supreme Court on Dec. 5. Mullins expressed excitement about seeing “Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s neckpiece” while hearing the case.\n\nThe couple has a busy schedule planned for the time they’re in D.C., which includes three speeches at different rallies. That’s consistent with the nearly 150 media interviews in which the couple has participated, ranging from the LGBT press to the New York Times.\n\n“I think it’s important for people to see us just for the fact of we’re standing up for ourselves,” Craig said. “We experienced discrimination and experienced what it means to follow it through this far.”\n\nDuring the arguments, the ACLU will represent the couple, another attorney will represent the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in defense of the non-discrimination and Alliance Defending Freedom will make Masterpiece Cakeshop’s arguments.\n\nBut another lawyer from the U.S. Justice Department under U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions may also take part: U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Francisco sought time to speak before the Supreme Court after the Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in favor of Masterpiece Cakeshop.\n\nMullins said the participation of the Trump administration in the litigation is “definitely notable,” but ultimately the Supreme Court will be making the decision in the case.\n\n“In the end, the Supreme Court is nine justices and nine votes and they will make their decisions, and so, in the end, the buck stops with them,” Mullins said.\n\nContrary to the experiences of many plaintiffs in LGBT rights cases, Mullins said the couple hasn’t faced significant backlash since the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\n\n“If anything, I feel like it made the story larger and it helped reach some people and changed some minds, of people who weren’t as aware of the story beforehand,” Mullins said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling in the Masterpiece Cakeshop will likely be issued next year and could be a milestone for the LGBT rights movement.\n\nCraig, however, said the impact is difficult to determine because the ruling could affect just Colorado law or similar statutes nationwide.\n\n“In the smallest sense they can validate what Colorado has already said, that he violated anti-discrimination laws here, and that would set a precedent for Colorado,” Craig said. “It could also set a precedent for the other 20 states that have the same public accommodations laws, or it could be as big as they’re sending a message to the whole nation that discriminating against gay people is wrong.”\n\nIn the event of a loss before the Supreme Court, Mullins said the decision would have deleterious consequences not just for LGBT people, but other marginalized groups.\n\n“If the Supreme Court found that a business owner could refuse to serve someone based on their strongly held religious beliefs, could a hotel owner refuse to rent a room to an interracial couple because his faith believed the races were not meant to mix, or could a business owner refuse to hire a single mother because his faith believed that mothers should be married?” Mullins said. “A loss at the Supreme Court could open the door to many forms of discrimination that have long been considered wrong in our society, and not just ones that involve LGBT people.”\n\nWin or lose, Craig said the lawsuit will be worth the effort because it means not just standing up for the thousands of people who’ve told the couple about their own discrimination stories as the litigation proceeded.\n\n“I feel like of course we’re standing up for ourselves, but the important thing is and what the Supreme Court decision is going to decide, is we’re standing up for these thousands of other people who are discriminated against all the time, and that’s really what keeps us going,” Craig said.', 'Meet the gay couple at the center of Masterpiece Cakeshop case', 0, 38.6),

But Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama’s nominee, a strategy that paid off when Donald Trump unexpectedly won the White House.\n\nAt the Federalist Society, Gorsuch recognized the improbable turn of events that led him from an appellate judgeship in his native Colorado to America’s highest court.\n\nIf someone had told Gorsuch a year ago what would soon transpire, “I would have said that you had taken way too much advantage of my home state’s generous drug laws,” he said.\n\nGorsuch likes to remind audiences of his relative youth, despite his head of silver hair, suggesting a long tenure on the bench. In front of a non-partisan audience last month, he talked about his teenage daughters and the regular, early morning 17-mile bike rides along the C&O canal that he does with a friend.\n\nHe spoke fondly of the horses, goats, chickens and rabbits on the small farm where his family lived outside Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Washington area this year. He enthusiastically recounted ski outings and his favourite moguls.\n\nEarly reviews of Gorsuch’s time on the court have varied with the ideological bent of his reviewers.\n\nWhile his confirmation was pending, the liberal Alliance for Justice worried that Gorsuch would often embrace the most conservative outcome on the high court.\n\n“Our concerns were confirmed,” said Nan Aron, the group’s president.\n\nDaniel Epps, a Washington University law professor in St. Louis and one-time law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, said he finds Gorsuch’s style sometimes grating, less so the substance of his questions at arguments.\n\nDuring a high-profile argument about politics in redistricting in October, Gorsuch began a question by suggesting that “maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter, the Constitution.”\n\nTo Epps, the tone was all wrong, especially for the new guy on the nine-member court. “I’d love to see a bit more recognition that the court deals with really hard questions that many people, including his colleagues, have struggled with for a long time. If someone thinks he has all the answers, maybe he’s missing something important,” Epps said.\n\nSome of Gorsuch’s choices of where to speak — with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell at the Trump International Hotel and at the Federalist Society dinner — also have fed perceptions that rubbed his critics the wrong way.\n\nThe dinner, Aron said, “was just the latest stop on Neil Gorsuch’s thank you tour to honour the people who got him what should have been Merrick Garland’s job.” Garland, an appeals court judge, the Obama nominee whom the Senate blocked.\n\n“I think he could have done a better job certainly in the public appearances he chooses to make to sort of send the signal that he’s not a Republican justice, he’s a justice,” said Epps, who also co-hosts the Supreme Court-focused First Mondays podcast.\n\nHis co-host, Ian Samuel, said there has been “a hysterical overreaction” to Gorsuch’s questions in the courtroom. Samuel, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Scalia law clerk, said Gorsuch has an obvious interest in questions about accountability in the American system of government and control over the court system. “It’s better that he puts it out there and says this is who I am. I don’t think he cares whether some people think it’s shocking,” Samuel said.\n\nLeonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice-president who has advised Trump on judicial picks, also took issue with Gorsuch’s critics when he introduced the justice at the dinner. “They mischaracterize candour and a demand for rigorous analysis as polarizing,” Leo said.\n\nGorsuch and Leo embraced on the podium, in front of an adoring crowd of like-minded lawyers, judges and academics. The Federalist Society, which counted Scalia among its earliest backers, has helped Trump identify candidates for federal judgeships and has members in legal jobs across his administration.\n\nGorsuch made no apologies either for the substance of his questions and writing, or his style. He talked at length about the importance of seeking out the meaning of the Constitution and laws as they were understood when they written.\n\n“Originalism has regained its place at the table of constitutional interpretation, and textualism in the reading of statutes has triumphed. And neither one is going anywhere on my watch,” Gorsuch said.\n\nHe went on to note that “some pundits have expressed bewilderment” about the questions he asks in court.\n\n“But while I have you here tonight, I thought I might just settle the matter once and for all by taking a poll. ... Should I just keep on asking about the text and original meaning of the Constitution?” he asked.\n\nThe response was predictably and overwhelmingly in favour.', 'In 7 months on US Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch has been just what conservatives hoped for ...', 0, 11.3),

(448, 'http://newsok.com/article/5573469', 'newsok', 'Unknown', '2017-11-25', 'IN an unexpected move, President Trump recently added Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Patrick Wyrick to a list of potential nominees for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy. Landing on a list is still a long way from serving on the court, of course, but Wyrick\'s possible ascension would still be a first for Oklahoma. More than 100 men and women have served on the high court since 1789, none of them Oklahomans.\n\nWyrick\'s appeal to Trump may be his youth. He\'s 36, so naming him to the nation\'s highest court would impact Supreme Court decisions for decades. Former Justice Joseph Story was 32 when appointed in 1811 and served until 1845.\n\nThe downside of Wyrick\'s relative youth is a much shorter resume than other contenders. He was hired as a solicitor general by former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt in 2011. In that role, he successfully argued a lethal injection case before the Supreme Court. And he has served on the Oklahoma Supreme Court only since February 2017.\n\nThe two decisions Wyrick is most associated with are a mixed bag for conservatives. He was author of a majority opinion striking down a cigarette “fee” as an unconstitutionally enacted tax increase, and he wrote a majority opinion declaring a new 1.25 percent automobile sales tax as not technically a tax increase.\n\nTime will tell if Wyrick is ever nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court. But the fact that an Oklahoman has made the list at all is notable.\n\nDeering\'s departure\n\nMaj. Gen. Myles Deering is retiring effective Jan. 31 as head of the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs, a job he has held since February 2015. Gov. Mary Fallin made the announcement this week. Deering\'s retirement will bring a close to more than 46 years in the military and public service. It also may provide some encouragement for officials in Talihina who hope to keep the VA Medical Center in that southeastern Oklahoma town. Some members of the Legislature have proposed closing the center and moving it to a larger city. In a meeting in October with The Oklahoman\'s editorial board, Talihina Mayor Don Faulkner and a former administrator, Roy Griffith, defended the VA center and said many problems it has experienced of late, such as attracting and keeping staff, stem from decisions Deering made after taking over as VA director. It will be interesting to see if the pending change in command at the VA alters the course of the Talihina center\'s future.\n\nLegislative exits\n\nThis week, Rep. Pat Ownbey, R-Ardmore, announced he will not seek re-election. Ownbey cited a desire to spend time with family, particularly grandchildren, and he will have served 10 years anyway. But Ownbey may be only the first of many legislative exits. The approval ratings of Gov. Mary Fallin and the Republican-controlled Legislature are poor. Republican voters are upset by efforts to raise taxes. Democrats are upset by the failure to raise numerous taxes. And citizens in both parties are sick of the dysfunction. Republican voter turnout in special elections has plummeted, allowing Democrats to win normally Republican districts. And county GOP organizations are actively recruiting primary challenges for Republican incumbents. In short, next year\'s elections may be bare-knuckle events that many incumbents will not survive anyway, so it won\'t be surprising if more lawmakers decide they need to “spend more time with my family.”\n\nOnline shopping hazard\n\nThe Christmas shopping season always produces stories of people who have had gifts stolen from their vehicles. Those who prefer buying their gifts online face the possibility of theft as well — from their stoop. USA Today reported this week on a survey by Xfinity Home, Comcast\'s home security service, which found that 30 percent of Americans have had items pilfered from outside their home. Fifty percent of respondents said they know someone who\'s had that happen to them. Among the 30 percent, those who live in the city experienced 42 percent of such thefts. That compared with 26 percent in the suburbs and 19 percent in rural areas. Most retailers re-ship products that are reported by customers as undelivered, a practice that would cover stolen items. Here\'s our suggestion for readers: Consider shopping local and pick up your package from one of The Oklahoman\'s many loyal advertisers.\n\nSex scandals\n\nThis year, several Oklahoma state lawmakers from both political parties have been accused of sex scandals of varying severity — with the most serious involving a child sex-trafficking offense. This has left Oklahomans red-faced, but citizens of Florida can empathize. The Florida Democratic Party chair, Stephen Bittel, resigned after published allegations that he created an uncomfortable work environment for young women. State Sen. Jack Latvala, a Republican who had already announced a gubernatorial bid, is under investigation after Politico Florida reported sexual harassment allegations against him from six women. He was forced to resign as Senate budget chairman as a result and faces potential expulsion. Jeff Clemens, the incoming Democratic leader in the Florida Senate, resigned in October after admitting an extramarital affair with a lobbyist. Sadly, one area not subject to partisan or state divisions is the prevalence of dishonorable people in politics.\n\nA worthy designation\n\nIn placing North Korea back on the State Department\'s list of state sponsors of terrorism, President Trump said it “should have happened a long time ago.” North Korea had been off the list for nine years, since being removed by the George W. Bush administration as part of negotiations over nuclear disarmament. North Korea said then that it would end its nuclear program but, naturally, did the opposite. “In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil,” Trump said. The North Korean regime is truly one of the world\'s most despicable. Although this designation is symbolic, the administration hopes it will dissuade other countries from dealing with Pyongyang. The Wall Street Journal noted that one way to test the conventional notion that North Korea will never abandon its nuclear goals “is by squeezing the regime as hard as possible on every front.” This designation will help do that.\n\nA judge\'s awful judgment\n\nIn Ohio, a state supreme court judge tried to be cute in defending U.S. Sen. Al Franken, who faces allegations that he groped women several years ago. Justice William O\'Neill, a Democratic candidate for governor, took to Facebook Nov. 17 to note that “the dogs of war” were calling for Franken\'s head, and so he wanted to “speak up for all heterosexual males.” O\'Neill wrote that in the past 50 years, he had been sexually intimate with approximately 50 “very attractive females.” “Now we can get back to discussing legalizing marijuana and opening the state hospital network to combat the opioid crisis,” he wrote. O\'Neill, not surprisingly, was met with blistering criticism, prompting him to apologize twice, including one in which he said he was headed to church to “get right with God.” Something tells us his gubernatorial bid will soon be a thing of the past — and rightly so.', 'Oklahoma ScissorTales: Oklahoman on potential SCOTUS list', -0.1, 19.9),

United States, pits law enforcement interests against the privacy rights of individuals.\n\nAt issue is whether law enforcement authorities need a search warrant to obtain historical cell-site records known as cell service location information (CSLI). The data are kept by phone companies to determine roaming charges and weak spots in their networks and show the cell tower a user connects with at any given time.\n\nThe facts of the Carpenter case are straightforward.\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and March 2011, Timothy Carpenter engineered a series of robberies of several cell phone stores in Ohio and Michigan. After Carpenter and his accomplices were arrested, the FBI requested and received several months of Carpenter\'s cell-site records.\n\n\n\nSuch requests are routinely granted by cell phone companies when law enforcement authorities can show that there are “reasonable grounds” the information is “relevant and material” to criminal investigation.\n\nThe information showed that Carpenter’s cell phone had connected with cell towers near the stores during the time of the robberies, leading to his conviction on 11 counts of armed robbery.\n\nCarpenter appealed his conviction, arguing that the government had unlawfully obtained his cell phone records without a search warrant. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth District ruled against him.\n\n\n\nThe court argued that that customers who voluntarily turn over their information to third parties such as cell phone companies, banks and other institutions have no “expectation of privacy.”\n\n\n\nIn two previous cases in the 1970s, United States v. Miller and Smith v. Maryland, the Supreme Court upheld the so-called “third party doctrine.”\n\n\n\nBut privacy advocates say the third party doctrine is not suitable for the digital age, arguing that increasingly sophisticated cell phones have become repositories of data that the government should not be able to access without probable cause.\n\n\n\nAndrew Ferguson, a professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia, joined a group of 42 criminal procedure and privacy scholars who filed a brief in support of Carpenter.\n\nIn an interview with VOA, Ferguson discussed the case and its implications for privacy rights.\n\nWhat is at issue in Carpenter v. US?\n\nThere is both a narrower issue and a broader issue that is potentially at play in Carpenter. The narrower issue is whether an exception to the Fourth Amendment, called the Third Party Doctrine, should survive the digital age. And the broader issue is, what does the Court do with a Fourth Amendment that was created in an era of small data when we are in a new world of surveillance?\n\n\n\nIf the court decides the Fourth Amendment doesn’t require a warrant for this data, it means police can actually, without any constitutional limitations, obtain all our personal data for really any reason they want. There are obviously legislative restrictions but as a constitutional matter it wouldn’t be a Fourth Amendment requirement to get a warrant, to obtain any of this personal information, be it your smart pacemaker, your smart Fitbit data that can tell whether you’re excited or not excited, and whether any of your information including where you’ve been via your cell phone and any other tracking technology.\n\nWhat is the government\'s argument?\n\nThe government essentially says you the consumer have no expectation of privacy in the information you give up to the third party cell provider. In fact, you probably don’t know how it works. The records that are created by these companies, they’re not your records, they’re the companies’ records.\n\nWhy would you have an expectation of privacy on the records that these companies did? If they were selling the data to other companies and made a profit, would you have a claim to the profit?\n\nNo. So what’s the difference between getting the information to the government? The government is getting it like any other party. Why would you be able to claim any sort of expectation of privacy over that information? The government’s position is that the Third Party Doctrine makes sense. It works well for law enforcement and this should just be an easy case of expanding and extending the Third Party Doctrine to the next question, which is the cell site locations.\n\nWhat is the counterargument?\n\nThe counterargument is that the precedent that the government is relying on deals with a different context. So the phone information that was at issue in the original Smith v. Maryland was not very revealing; it was basically the number you called. It wasn’t going to show where you’d been, who you’d visited, the places you’d gone the last few times. It was a situation where you at the time of the old fashioned phone calls voluntarily giving up the information. You knew you were making phone calls. Here, whether or not you use your cell phone, your cell phone is giving off that information so you can’t say it’s voluntary relinquishment of your expectation of privacy because if you’re on the phone, that’s the way it works. So there is something about the private nature of this data.\n\nThere is something about the Fourth Amendment controls locations and the ability to go places without the government surveillance and oversight. And these old fashioned cases should be left in the past because the new world is too invasive, too revealing of digital clues, and the fourth amendment needs to adapt.\n\n\n\nIn the brief you and a group of scholars filed in the case, you argue that an extension of the so called Third Party Doctrine “could eliminate citizens’ privacy in the modern age.” Are the stakes that high?\n\nI think they are. If you don’t require a warrant to get this kind of information, and there is not legislation protecting it, there is no constitutional barrier for police to obtain information even about the justices themselves or about individuals who they sort of suspect but don\'t have great reason to suspect. It’s going to chill First Amendment association and the ability to get together for political activism. And it\'s going to reveal a whole host of intimate details that most of us would like to keep private from our government.\n\nWhat if the court rules in favor of Carpenter?\n\n\n\nIf the court rules in favor of Carpenter, and says police are required to get a warrant before doing it, I think it will just settle into a status quo where police get warrants for their criminal investigation.\n\nThere may be some here they won’t be able to do that, and it will be an impediment to law enforcement, but by and large they’re doing it already. Right now, most private companies say, look we follow the law. If the law requires a warrant, we require a warrant, and if the law doesn’t require a warrant, we don’t require a warrant.\n\n\n\nAre there any international ramifications?\n\nEurope is far more protective of data privacy than the U.S. has ever been and has moved there quicker and in more robust fashion. So in many cases, the U.S. has lessons to learn from Europe as opposed to if you care about data privacy and how to protect it. So it may be in a case that people around the world will see this as an American phenomenon, wrestling with what the fourth amendment means.\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, it raises big questions because most of the tech companies are global companies, most of the issues involved privacy, which is certainly not a uniquely American concern, and the technologies are going to be used and sought after by governments in lots of repressive governments that are going to see the ability to use big data surveillance technology, big data policing technologies, to control their citizens. And one way you can see a lot of the rise of big data policing is as a measure of social control.', 'US Supreme Court Hears Arguments in Pivotal Case for Digital Privacy', -0.1, 21.3),

(Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — Timothy Carpenter\'s mistake in the armed robberies of cellphone stores in Michigan and Ohio may have been his decision to carry a cellphone.\n\nTo obtain Carpenter\'s conviction and lengthy prison sentence, police relied on data obtained without a warrant from wireless carriers revealing where he had been over a 127-day period. Courts upheld the search of cell tower records under the theory that people who give information to third parties have no expectation of privacy.\n\nBut if that\'s the case, privacy groups warn, what about email and text messages, social media communications and intimate photos? What about Internet browsing histories and WebMD medical queries, or books, groceries and drugs bought online? What about today\'s \"Internet of Things\" — Fitbits and medical devices, cameras and security systems, Google Home and Siri?\n\nNot to worry: The Supreme Court is on the case.\n\nWithout shedding their affinity for morning coats and quill pens nor their disdain for communicating by email, the justices on Wednesday will hear Carpenter\'s lawyers argue that the so-called \"third-party doctrine\" presents a clear and present danger in the digital age.\n\n“This is the most important Fourth Amendment case we’ve seen in a generation,” said Nathan Freed Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union, who will argue the case in court. A ruling in favor of the government, he said, would \"make our lives into an open book.”\n\nNonsense, says the Trump administration, backed by 19 states and the nation\'s district attorneys, While tracking suspects\' travels has proved invaluable to law enforcement, they argue, a decision in favor of the third-party doctrine need not open the door to email and other data stored on the Internet or in the cloud.\n\n\"If businesses’ possession of great quantities of digital information raises new privacy concerns, legislatures are well positioned to address them,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco\'s brief to the court says. \"Policymakers can enact additional privacy protections if society deems them warranted.\"\n\n\'There\'s an app for that\'\n\nTo prosecute their case against Carpenter for the 2010 and 2011 robberies, the government used cellphone records to locate him 12,898 times over 127 days — an average of 101 times daily that he tried to send or receive calls, texts, emails or other information.\n\nThe records were obtained under the Stored Communications Act of 1986, which allows phone companies to turn over records if the government has \"reasonable grounds\" to believe they will help a criminal investigation. A search warrant requires a tougher \"probable cause\" standard.\n\nIn 2016, police made some 125,000 requests for cellphone location data from Verizon and AT&T alone, often involving several suspects over periods of months.\n\nThe Supreme Court has veered in recent decades from permitting to prohibiting such searches. In two cases from the 1970s, the court ruled that criminal suspects had no privacy rights in records maintained by banks and phone companies — the latter case involving the numbers called from landlines.\n\nBut in recent years, the justices have swung back the other way. In 2012, they ruled 9-0 that police violated a suspect\'s rights by attaching a GPS tracker to his car for 28 days. While the case was decided on trespassing grounds, five justices said the third-party doctrine might be out of date.\n\n\"This approach is ill-suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote.\n\nTwo years later, the court ruled unanimously that police cannot search cellphones and smartphones during arrests without a warrant. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the devices were \"a pervasive and insistent part of daily life.\"\n\n\"The phrase, \'There\'s an app for that\' is now part of the popular lexicon,\" Roberts wrote. \"The average smartphone user has installed 33 apps, which together can form a revealing montage of the user\'s life.\"\n\n300,000 cell towers\n\nThis week\'s case focuses not on the contents of Carpenter\'s phone or his text and voice conversations, but on his whereabouts. When the robberies were committed, data from cell towers identified Carpenter\'s location within a few miles, often just a few hundred yards. Today, with more than 300,000 cell towers in the United States, the data is even more accurate.\n\nDefenders of the status quo contend that increased convenience and security requires some loss of privacy. \"Most Americans understand that there is a necessary diminution of privacy in the digital era and are willing to accept the tradeoff,\" the National District Attorneys Association said in court papers.\n\nBut given the granularity of the data, technology companies and privacy rights groups argue that the third-party doctrine must be revised. More than 95% of U.S. adults have cellphones and 77% own smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center. Worldwide, people send and receive 269 billion emails every day and share more than 3.5 billion photos.\n\n\"Transmitting personal data to the companies that provide digital products and services is an unavoidable condition of using technologies that people find beneficial and useful, and forgoing the use of those technologies for many is not an option,\" says a brief submitted on behalf of major technology companies — including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Verizon.\n\nForty-two scholars of criminal procedure and privacy filed court papers lambasting continued use of the third-party doctrine in the digital age. \"Smartphones, smart homes, smart cars, and smart medical devices connected through the Internet of Things are only \'smart\' because of third-party interconnectivity,\" they wrote.\n\nAnd the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute warned that the records available through third parties \"can reveal excruciatingly intimate details about physical and mental health, as well as marital and family relations.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear challenges to two state gun control laws Monday, in keeping with its recent reluctance to decide cases involving the Second Amendment.\n\nThe lawsuits in question challenged gun control laws in Maryland and Florida. Maryland adopted a so-called assault weapons ban following the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in 2012, while Florida has a long-standing ban on the open carry of firearms. The challenge to Maryland’s law was backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\nBoth laws were upheld by lower courts. Ten of the fourteen judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Maryland’s law in February, while the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the state’s open carry ban in March.\n\nThe 4th Circuit explained that relevant Supreme Court precedents allow state governments to regulate “military-style” weapons.\n\n“Put simply, we have no power to extend Second Amendment protection to the weapons of war that the Heller decision explicitly excluded from such coverage,” Judge Robert King wrote for the majority, referring to a 2008 Supreme Court decision which affirmed a constitutional right to possess firearms in the home for self-defense.\n\nKing also sat on a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit which heard the case in 2016. In a partial dissent from the court’s ruling, King used the same “weapons of war” language he would later revive in his opinion for the full 4th Circuit.\n\n“Let’s be real: The assault weapons banned by Maryland’s FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war,” he wrote. “In fact, the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles, the AR-15, functions almost identically to the military’s fully automatic M16.”\n\nFor its part, a four-justice majority of the Florida Supreme Court concluded that the open-carry ban corresponds to the government’s interest in public safety without infringing on the right to bear arms.\n\n“[We] are satisfied that the state’s prohibition on openly carrying firearms in public with specified exceptions — such as authorizing the open carrying of guns to and from and during lawful recreational activities — while still permitting those guns to be carried, albeit in a concealed manner, reasonably fits the state’s important government interests of public safety and reducing gun-related violence,” Justice Barbara Pariente wrote.\n\nThe justices have declined to take up a major Second Amendment case since deciding an important pair of cases in 2008 and 2010. The 2008 Heller decision concluded that the federal government could not enact laws restricting the right to possess guns in the home for self defense. The 2010 McDonald decision extended that ruling, forbidding state and local governments from adopting such laws.\n\nIn each case, however, the justices indicated that the Constitution permitted certain firearms regulations, though they were not specific as to the sort of laws that would pass Second Amendment muster. Since 2010 they have taken practically no action to clarify this important question.\n\nLower federal courts, in the mean time, have adopted a fairly narrow view of the Heller and McDonald decisions, affirming a raft of gun control measures. The 9th Circuit upheld a San Diego County policy that restricts access to concealed carry permits, while the 2nd Circuit upheld a Connecticut law adding 183 additional weapons to its existing assault weapons ban.\n\nThe high court’s silence has elicited criticism from diverse quarters. Dahlia Lithwick, a liberal court-watcher who writes for Slate and hosts the podcast “Amicus,” accused the justices of foisting a gun rights crisis on the entire nation, which they now refuse to solve.\n\n“We know now that we have a ‘right’ and that it implicates our ‘freedom,’ but the Supreme Court has left us to guess at what the contours of that right and that freedom might be,” she wrote in October.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas chided his colleagues in June after the Court declined to review the 9th Circuit’s decision upholding San Diego’s policy. His short dissent was joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\n“[T]he Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense,” he wrote. “I do not think we should stand by idly while a state denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.”\n\nFollow Kevin on Twitter\n\nSend tips to [email protected].\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Breyer, expressed a concern.\n\n“Suppose that the patent has been in existence without anybody re-examining it for 10 years and, moreover, the company’s invested $40 billion in developing it,” he said. “And then suddenly somebody comes in and says, ‘Oh, want it re-examined, not in court but by the patent office.’”\n\nHe later suggested that the Supreme Court could uphold the procedure in the case before it but “leave open the question of what happens if there has been huge investment.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChief Justice John G.

Kise, a lawyer for Greene’s Energy, whether his position was that “you’ve got to take the bitter with the sweet.”\n\nThe chief justice elaborated. “If you want the sweet of having a patent,” he said, “you’ve got to take the bitter that the government might re-evaluate it at some subsequent point.”\n\nMr. Kise agreed with that characterization of his position.\n\nChief Justice Roberts responded that the court’s precedents have said that “you cannot put someone in that position.”\n\nMalcolm L. Stewart, a deputy solicitor general who was defending the tribunal procedure, said it was not unusual for administrative agencies to act like judicial bodies. “It happens all the time that executive-branch agencies get input from private people before making their decisions,” he said.\n\n“When the solicitor general is deciding whether to file an amicus brief,” he said, referring to friend-of-the-court briefs, “we will read the papers that were submitted to this court. We’ll have meetings with the parties that resemble oral arguments.”\n\n“Even though our procedures may resemble the court’s procedures,” Mr. Stewart said, “the decision that we make is the decision to file an amicus brief on behalf of the United States.

The Roberts Court has waded—some would say jumped—into such contentious issues as school desegregation, guns and the Second Amendment, Guantanamo Bay detainees, the Affordable Care Act, abortion, voting rights, and same sex marriage.\n\nRemember: it only takes the votes of four of the nine justices to grant review in a case. The court doesn’t disclose who voted for or against reviewing a case, but sometimes it seems obvious.\n\nLast year, for example, the justices deadlocked in a challenge to the “fair share” fees that nonunion members must pay public employee unions that are required to represent all workers, to cover the costs of collective bargaining. During arguments in that case, it appeared that the court’s five conservative justices were ready to strike down the fees and reverse a 40-year-old decision upholding them. With Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, the eight-justice court divided 4-4, failing to resolve a First Amendment issue.\n\nThe high court has agreed to consider another case raising the same issue in the current term. It’s unlikely that the four liberal justices would have voted to take up the issue again now that the conservatives are back to a majority.\n\nCell phones aren’t new, but law enforcement’s desire to access their data and other aspects raises new issues for the courts.\n\nMuch harder to predict are the possible outcomes in the three challenges likely to capture headlines during the two-week argument session that begins Nov. 27. And each has important ramifications going beyond their facts.\n\nCell phones and privacy rights\n\nFirst up — cellphone location data on Nov. 29. In the last few terms, the justices increasingly have been faced with the intersection of new technology, the Constitution and privacy rights. Cell phones aren’t new, but law enforcement’s desire to access their data and other aspects raises new issues for the courts.\n\nIn Carpenter v. United States, Timothy Carpenter was suspected by Detroit police in 2011 of masterminding a series of Ohio and Michigan armed robberies. Police sought and obtained—without a warrant—cellphone location data on Carpenter from his wireless carrier that covered a period of 127 days.\n\nMagistrate judges approved the police requests under the Stored Communications Act of 1986. Under the act, the government can require disclosure of certain telecommunications records when “specific and articulable facts show that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.” No warrant supported by probable cause to believe a crime has been committed is required.\n\nThe cell site data from Carpenter’s phone showed that he had been within a half mile to two miles of the location of each of the robberies. Carpenter tried and failed to block the government’s use of this evidence in his trial. He argued that under the Fourth Amendment, the police were required to get a warrant based on probable cause. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.\n\nCarpenter makes the same Fourth Amendment argument in the Supreme Court, where he has drawn support from privacy groups and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, among others. The government’s supporters include a coalition of states and the National District Attorneys Association.\n\nIn recent GPS and cellphone-related cases, a majority of the justices has been concerned about the privacy rights of users. The government argues that users have no expectation of privacy in cell site data kept by their carriers.\n\nSports betting and the division of powers\n\nOn Dec. 4, a week after the justices wrestle with cellphone site data, they will hear arguments in New Jersey’s constitutional attack on the federal ban on sports betting. New Jersey’s Governor Chris Christie and the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association argue that the 1992 federal ban violates the Tenth Amendment under the “anti-commandeering” doctrine. The National Collegiate Athletic Association disagrees.\n\nWhatever the justices say in this case could have major implications for federal-state relations.\n\nThat doctrine doesn’t come up very often in the high court. Its purpose is to protect our system of dual sovereignty—the division of powers between the national and state governments. The argument in this case is that the federal gambling ban unconstitutionally bars the states that have their own sports betting prohibitions from changing their laws to allow some betting—which is what New Jersey wants to do.\n\nSo this is a federalism, or states’ rights case, and that’s why it could be the term’s “sleeper” blockbuster. As Christie and his supporters tell the court, states have enacted some policies that the federal government does not view favorably, for example, legalization of medical marijuana and adoption of so-called sanctuary city policies in the immigration context.\n\nWhatever the justices say in this case could have major implications for federal-state relations. And also, of course, for sports betting—a $150 billion-a-year industry.\n\nThe wedding cake case\n\nFinally, the most talked-about case of three goes before the justices on Dec. 5: Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Colorado baker Jack Phillips refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because, he said, it was contrary to his religious beliefs. The baker violated the state’s anti-discrimination law.\n\nColorado’s Anti-Discrimination Act forbids businesses engaged in sales to the public from denying service because of a customer’s sexual orientation. In the Supreme Court, the baker argues that applying the state law to him violates his First Amendment speech and exercise of religion rights. Colorado counters that the case is “about the integrity of a 150-year-old principle: when a business opens its doors to the general public, it may not reject customers because of who they are.”\n\nNearly 100 “friend of the court” briefs have been filed by religious and civil rights groups across the political spectrum. The Trump administration supports the baker. Keep an eye on this one. A decision has the potential to affect many more individuals and businesses than the baker and same-sex couple at the center of the case.\n\nRemember: you can read the transcript of the arguments on the same day on the court’s website. The transcripts usually are posted mid to late afternoon.

The flag incorporates the Confederate battle flag in its upper left corner.\n\nThe justices did not provide a reason for rejecting the appeal. A federal appeals court in April rejected the lawsuit owing to lack of standing, as NPR\'s Camila Domonoske explained:\n\n\n\n\"The central question was whether the man had standing to sue — which depended on whether he had experienced an \'injury in fact.\' The appeals court didn\'t deny that the flag might have a deep and personal effect on the man.

He also wanted the justices to deem unconstitutional a statute that called for schoolchildren in the state — such as his own daughter — to be taught \"proper respect\" for the flag and for the \" \'official pledge of the State of Mississippi,\' which reads: I salute the flag of Mississippi and the sovereign state for which it stands with pride in her history and achievements and with confidence in her future under the guidance of Almighty God.\"\n\n\"The message in Mississippi\'s flag has always been one of racial hostility and insult and it is pervasive and unavoidable by both children and adults,\" Moore\'s appeal reads. \"The state\'s continued expression of its message of racial disparagement sends a message to African-American citizens of Mississippi that they are second class citizens.\"\n\nMoore said in court documents that for him, exposure to the flag is \"painful, threatening, and offensive.\" He added that seeing the flag at courthouses creates a \"hostile work and business environment.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post shared by his law firm on Monday, Moore praised his lawyers for \"a valiant fight.\" He wrote: \"If the state flag is to change it will be up to the people or the elected representatives.

Soriano, partner at Duane Morris LLP in New Jersey.\n\nWe are less than one week away from what could be a revolutionary day for proponents of legalized, regulated sports betting in the U.S.On Monday, 4 December, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the state of New Jersey should be able to legalize sports betting , even though federal law currently bans it in 46 states. The case, dubbed Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, is a battle between New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the state\'s Thoroughbred Horsemen\'s Association versus the NCAA and all four professional sports leagues (NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL). If Christie and the state prevail, not only would it provide an almost immediate green light for Las Vegas-style sports betting inside New Jersey\'s withering casino venues, but it could also open the door for other states to do the same.With so many questions about the case in anticipation of Monday\'s pivotal hearing, we turned to Christopher L. Soriano for some answers. Soriano, who will be in attendance at the hearing on Monday, is a partner in the Cherry Hill, N.J., office of Duane Morris LLP and concentrates his practice in gaming law, where he represents casino operators, gaming equipment manufacturers, iGaming companies, financial institutions and other participants in the gaming industry.The Supreme Court hears oral arguments between October and April , usually hearing two arguments per day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The arguments are an opportunity for the justices to ask questions directly to the attorneys representing the parties in the case, and for the attorneys to highlight arguments they view as important.Monday\'s hearing will begin around 10 a.m. ET and last about one hour. Usually, each side gets 30 minutes, but in this case the federal government has asked permission to argue on behalf of the sports leagues. So, on Monday the state will get 30 minutes, the leagues will get 20 minutes and the solicitor general representing the federal government will get 10 minutes.All nine justices will hear the arguments, and Soriano said that they typically do not allow a lot of time for discussion or back-and-forth.\"It will be mostly questions from the justices, and the questions will come hard and fast,\" he said. \"You can often watch the arguments and think to yourself, \'Wow, that person has no chance,\' but then when the other side has their turn they get peppered just as hard and then you don’t know what to think.\"Very rarely, according to Soriano. Of the 7,000 or so cases the Supreme Court gets asked to hear every year, less than 100 are actually selected.\"The fact that they decided to hear this case means that at least four of the nine justices believe there is a question of significant importance on a national level regarding this case,\" Soriano explained. \"But we don\'t know which four, or if there were more than four.\"Bad news for those hoping for a quick result: Once the arguments are over, the case will be taken under advisement and the court will have an internal conference. One of the justices will be assigned to write the opinion , but it may not be released for months.\"It can happen any time between now and the end of June, so my guess is we don\'t hear anything until March or later because it takes so long to write the opinion,\" Soriano said. \"And they don\'t give you any indication as to when it will be released. You\'ve just got to watch the blogs and social media on the days when they release opinions and see if it\'s going to be the day.\"While Soriano said that it\'s a \"dangerous exercise\" to try and predict what the Supreme Court will do in any case, he says that chances are one of the following three things will happen:1. The court agrees with the 3rd Circuit decision, affirms that the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which bans sports betting in 46 states, but allows Nevada, Montana, Oregon and Delaware to operate sportsbooks, is constitutional and the full repeal by New Jersey is not permitted. \"In this case, you are pretty much stuck with it for a long time,\" Soriano said. \"Once the Supreme Court concludes that a statute is constitutional, they\'re not going to turn around and change it, so, at this point, if you want expanded sports betting there has to be some legislative change.\"2. The court rules that PASPA is constitutional, but New Jersey\'s partial repeal complies with PASPA. In this case, if other states want to have sports betting, all they will have to do is use a similar partial repeal. \"This leads to a situation where it becomes very interesting as to whether sports betting could be regulated in the casinos,\" Soriano said. \"Because if you look at the language of PASPA, it makes it hard for the states to regulate.\"3. The court concludes that the entire statute is unconstitutional and needs to be tossed, in which case there would no longer be a federal ban on sports betting. In turn, individual states would do what they want and choose to opt-in or opt-out. Also in under this scenario, Congress could take another shot at a different version of PASPA, or a determination could be made that sports betting is something that should be permitted, but on a federal basis rather than state-by-state. \"I don\'t think that\'s likely because so much of gambling is state-by-state,\" Soriano added. \"If anything, I think that PASPA just goes away and any state that wants to implement sports betting does it, and the states that don’t want to, don\'t. It\'s that simple.\"Soriano said that while the above three results are most probable, there are two wildcards that, while unlikely, are not completely out of the question.1. The court concludes that PASPA is unconstitutional, but only because it permits sports betting in Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon. \"As a result, the court would strike the grandfather provision and now sports betting is illegal in the other four states,\" Soriano said. \"It\'s a real sleeper. No one is arguing for this, but it\'s something that the court could do.\"2. The Supreme Court decides that it never should have heard arguments in the first place and within a week or two there would be an order that says the decision is dismissed and the 3rd Circuit decision remains law. \"This only happens maybe once a year or every two years,\" Soriano added. \"It\'s rare, but it\'s on the table. The Supreme Court can do whatever it wants. That\'s why they\'re the Supreme Court.\"While all of the above are music to the ears of those of us who, at long last, want legalized sports betting in the U.S., they will have zero impact on what the Supreme Court decides.\"They may matter for future lobbying efforts and interests, but none of it really matters to the Supreme Court,\" Soriano said. \"People need to understand that the Supreme Court justices are not gaming law experts, they’re constitutional law experts. They\'re looking at what, if any, implications from a constitutional perspective are at stake here.\"They are not interested in whether or not sports betting is a good thing or a bad thing. They’re not passionate about the issue of sports betting. This is more of a vehicle for them to reexamine the balance of power in the federal state government. All they\'re looking at is how the ruling they make in this case governs what happens in other cases down the road.\"Gov. Christie is already on record as saying that Monmouth Park would be ready to accept bets \"inside a week to 10 days\" if the Supreme Court sides with the state, since William Hill has already built a sports bar on the property that resembles a Las Vegas sportsbook. Elsewhere, MGM Resorts International announced earlier this month that it is making plans to begin construction on a $7 million sportsbook at The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa \"My guess is that the technology is already in place and a switch could be flipped pretty quickly,\" Soriano said. \"The only thing you would need is an emergency adoption of regulation by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, and I\'m sure that, given they have been at the forefront of this case, they\'ll be ready to regulate quickly.\"In a word, yes.\"I would think within the first year at least 10 more states would follow suit,\" Soriano predicted. \"I could see the more mature gaming jurisdictions like Pennsylvania, New York, Louisiana and Mississippi, to name a few, moving quickly. And even though California is tribal, it could also happen there pretty quickly because everyone knows there are a lot of potential customers there.\"If the result is that there is no federal prohibition on sports betting, states that have lotteries but not casinos could very likely offer sports bets through the lottery.\"With no PASPA, states are free to do whatever they want, so if they wanted to do lottery sports betting they would be free to do so,\" Soriano said.As for online sports betting, Soriano warns that would be a bit more complicated because of the Federal Wire Act.\"It’s an interesting question,\" he said. \"There\'s one school of thought that says on an inter-state basis it\'s OK to place to place wagers online right now, like what is done in Nevada. The other school of thought is that doing it online is still a violation of the Federal Wire Act, and perhaps UIGEA, and would probably require some more study. My guess is that a lot of operators would study it very carefully before going that route.\"As much as he would like to try an peer into his crystal ball, get inside the Supreme Court\'s head and forecast what will happen, Soriano said it\'s \"impossible to handicap\" what will transpire.\"I don\'t dare to make any predictions right now,\" he said with a shrug. \"Maybe try me again after the arguments are made. Then I might be more willing to make a prediction depending on what I see and hear, but right now I\'m not willing to make a guess. Until something is written in ink on formal Supreme Court opinion paper, anything we do now is a complete guessing game.\"But I will say this: There are at least four justices who are interested enough in the case to make it worth hearing because they thought something wasn\'t quite right with the lower court\'s decision. That\'s a fact, but that\'s as far as you can go at this point.\"', 'Top 10 questions and answers regarding New Jersey\'s sports betting US Supreme Court hearing', -0.1, 18),

It’s also predicted to be the first year that purchases made from smart phones and tablets surpass those made from desktop computers. With all this growth in how and how much consumers spend online, it’s worth checking in on the state of affairs for how those purchases are taxed.\n\nThe law of the land remains a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case, Quill v. North Dakota. It says that sales tax can only be applied to purchases when the seller has a physical presence (like a store or warehouse) in the buyer’s state.\n\nThis isn’t an arbitrary tax loophole, but a practical application of the principle of “no taxation without representation.” The seller, by remitting the tax and being subject to audit, is the legal taxpayer for sales taxes. And so it follows that remote sellers should not be obligated to remit tax funds to another state where they have no political voice.\n\nCEI has written extensively about the practical problems with online retailers calculating and paying taxes in the approximately 10,000 distinct sales tax jurisdictions across the country, all with their own bases, rates, and exemptions. We’ve also laid out what a workable and constitutional solution would look like in the form of an “origin-based” regime.\n\nStates wishing to expand their taxing powers outside their borders, turning a blind eye to the constitutional and functional harms, have spent decades fruitlessly lobbying Congress for federal legislation, organizing a doomed project to simplify sales tax bases and rates, and finally just passing their own unconstitutional legislation. Now they may finally have their day in court.\n\nThis September, the Supreme Court of South Dakota refused to vacate a judgment from a lower court that struck down that state’s 2016 law requiring out-of-state online retailers who sold more than $100,000 or had more than 200 transactions, to collect and remit sales taxes. This allowed South Dakota to take its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in the hopes of overturning Quill.\n\nIt’s unclear if the high court will agree to hear the case, let alone if it will affirm Quill’s protection of interstate commerce, or overturn to grant states unprecedented taxing authority.

Carpenter is serving a 116-year prison term for his role in the robberies.\n\n\"The whole question is whether the information is accessible to the government\" without a warrant, Roberts said. Investigators were able to get the cell tower records with a court order that requires a lower standard than the probable cause, or strong evidence that a person has committed a crime, that police must show to get a warrant.\n\nUnderlying the argument was some justices\' wariness of new technology and its ability to track not just movements, but purchases, subscriptions, internet searches and every aspect of Americans\' lives.\n\n\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\n\nOn the other side, Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy seemed most receptive to the administration\'s argument that privacy rights do not come into play when the government gets records from telecommunications providers and other companies that keep records of their transactions with customers.\n\n\"The technology here is new, but the legal principles the court has articulated under the Fourth Amendment are not,\" Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben said.\n\nThe administration relied in part on a 1979 Supreme Court decision that treated phone records differently than the conversation in a phone call, for which a warrant generally is required.\n\nThe court said then that people had no expectation of privacy in the records of calls made and kept by the phone company. That case involved a single home telephone.\n\nThe Supreme Court in recent years has acknowledged technology\'s effects on Americans\' privacy. In 2014, the court held unanimously that police must generally get a warrant to search the cellphones of people they arrest. Other items people carry with them may be looked at without a warrant, after an arrest.\n\nThe robberies took place at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in 2010 and 2011. Carpenter organized most of the robberies, in which he signalled the others in his group to enter the stores with their guns drawn, according to the government\'s Supreme Court brief. Customers and employees were herded to the back and the robbers filled their bags with new smartphones. They got rid of the guns and sold the phones, the government said.\n\nPolice learned of Carpenter\'s involvement after a confession by another person involved in the holdups. They got an order for cellphone tower data for Carpenter\'s phone, which shows which towers a phone has connected with when used in a call. The records help approximate someone\'s location.\n\nCourts around the country have wrestled with the issue. The most relevant Supreme Court case is nearly 40 years old, before the dawn of the digital age, and the law on which prosecutors relied to obtain the records dates from 1986, when few people had cellphones.\n\nThe judge at Carpenter\'s trial refused to suppress the records, and a federal appeals court agreed. The Trump administration said the lower court decisions should be upheld.\n\nEven if Carpenter wins at the Supreme Court, it may not matter to his conviction or sentence.\n\n\"Is any of this going to do any good for Mr. Carpenter?\" Alito asked.', 'US Supreme Court could limit police in digital-age privacy case', -0.1, 8.5),

New Jersey is seeking to overturn the 1992 federal law that bars single-game sports gambling in every state except Nevada. Should that effort succeed, other states could move quickly to grab part of the $150 billion the casino-backed American Gaming Association says is wagered illegally every year.\n\n\"The gold rush is ready to begin,\" said Daniel Wallach, an expert on sports and gaming law at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nNew Jersey wagering advocates say legalization could revitalize Atlantic City, the gambling center where Trump once owned casinos. Among the most ardent proponents is Christie, whose support for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign was part of an on-again, off-again relationship that almost resulted in a cabinet position.\n\nAlso read: Trump’s NFL Feud Actually Began 34 Years Ago in Swamps of Jersey\n\nThe nation’s largest pro sports leagues and the National Collegiate Athletic Association are leading the fight against the state, even as some of them inch closer to embracing gambling themselves. National Basketball Association Commissioner Adam Silver has said that Congress should let states authorize wagering, subject to strict regulation and technical safeguards.\n\n\"There is an obvious appetite among sports fans for a safe and legal way to wager on professional sporting events,\" Silver wrote in the New York Times in 2014.\n\nNew Jersey has been trying to legalize sports gambling in its casinos for years, starting with a 2012 law that explicitly authorized wagering. Federal courts struck down that measure as violating the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sport Protection Act, or PASPA. That law says states other than Nevada may not \"sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license or authorize by law or compact\" a sports-gambling system.\n\nNew Jersey then took a less direct approach by exempting racetracks and Atlantic City casinos from its gambling prohibition but not explicitly authorizing wagering or setting up a new regulatory system. A Philadelphia-based federal appeals court voted 10-2 to strike down that law as well, siding with the leagues and the federal government, then controlled by the Obama administration.\n\n10th Amendment\n\nIn their appeal, Christie and other New Jersey officials point to Supreme Court decisions barring the federal government from \"commandeering\" a state’s regulatory power. New Jersey says those rulings, which invoke the Constitution’s 10th Amendment, mean the state can’t be required to maintain its prohibition on gambling.\n\n\"A federal court, purporting to enforce federal law, now is dictating the contents of New Jersey’s state law concerning sports wagering,\" the state argued in court papers.\n\nNew Jersey says the state law’s opponents conceded during the first round of litigation that the state wouldn’t violate PASPA if it simply repealed its gambling prohibition.\n\nBut the leagues and Trump administration say that’s not what New Jersey did. They call the latest law a selective repeal that legalizes gambling only in highly regulated casinos and racetracks.\n\n\"New Jersey wishes to do what PASPA prohibits: to authorize sports gambling at its licensed casinos and racetracks,\" Trump’s solicitor general, Noel Francisco, argued in court papers.\n\n\"Congress does not commandeer the states just because it limits their policy options,\" the leagues argued.\n\nIdeological Divide\n\nThe state’s contentions are likely to resonate with the court’s conservative wing, and the justices could divide along ideological lines. That happened in 1997, when the court struck down a requirement that local law enforcement agencies run background checks on would-be gun buyers.

The United States, which has provoked doubts regarding the privacy of the American public in the digital age. The issue is FBI requests to cellphone companies that they hand over data pertaining to robbery suspect Timothy Carpenter.\n\nCarpenter was convicted in 2013 for a string of armed robberies at RadioShack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan that occurred in 2011. The FBI had initially been unable to build a case against Carpenter, until it received 127 days of cellphone data from mobile companies that allowed the agency to track the suspect’s location. The privacy concern is that they did this without a court-issued search warrant, thereby posing the question of whether the search was unlawful under the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.\n\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Americans should be concerned about the government’s ability to surveil the public. “Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid big brother,” she said. “They want to avoid the concept that government will be able to see and locate you anywhere you are at any point in time.”\n\nCarpenter, convicted on six counts of robbery, later lost an appeal when a Cincinnati court ruled that no warrant was required. The American Civil Liberties Union argued otherwise, stating that police need “probable cause.”\n\n“It would imperil the privacy of all kinds of data that we really can’t avoid creating in the digital age,” ACLU staff attorney Nathan Freed Wessler told The Verge. “Some are queries we enter into Google, our web browsing history, medical information, fertility tracking data from a smartphone app, [and] new information from ‘internet of things’ devices we put in our homes.”\n\nThe government invoked the 1986 Stored Communications Act – updated in 1994 – to defend the seizure. Wessler, who was defending Carpenter, counter-argued that things have changed since 1994. “Three-tenths of 1 percent of Americans had cell phones in 1986; only 9 percent in 1994,” he said. “There were about 18,000 cell towers in 1994; today there are over 300,000.”\n\nHis argument is that in the digital age, we are unwittingly signing ourselves over to omnipresent surveillance if we don’t totally opt out of being digitally connected. “Never could police have decided today to track me 24 hours a day, seven days a week, five months ago,” Wessler said. “That is a categorically new power that is made possible by these perfect tracking devices that 95 percent of Americans carry in their pockets.”\n\nTech companies earlier this year, such as Facebook Inc., Google Inc. Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. signed an amicus brief in support of Carpenter. The brief said that the Court should “refine the application of certain Fourth Amendment doctrines to ensure that the law realistically engages with Internet-based technologies and with people’s expectations of privacy in their digital data.”\n\nA decision is expected sometime in June next year.\n\nImage: Mao Tsé-Tung via Flickr', 'US Supreme Court considers limiting \'Big Brother\' tracking of mobile data by police', -0.1, 7.9),

United States, is centered around the question of whether the Fourth Amendment — which protects U.S. citizens from unreasonable search and seizure — applies to the location data from smartphones that is routinely gathered by cell service providers. Basically, the case could decide whether law enforcement or other authorities can obtain location data from your smartphone without a warrant.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for some time. Timothy Carpenter, the defendant in the case, was a mastermind behind a slew of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio. Carpenter was arrested in 2011, after authorities were able to gather a large amount of location data without a warrant. Carpenter later appealed, arguing that this location data should be covered under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nBut law enforcement officials contend that the warrantless collection of data is legally protected by a principle known as the third-party doctrine. This principle states that information you voluntarily share with “someone else” isn’t protected by the Fourth Amendment, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Jennifer Lynch explains.\n\nIn other words, because “someone else” is vague, authorities claim that location data is “voluntarily” shared just by using a cell company’s services. And, notably, this is the decision that lower appeals courts have upheld thus far.\n\nOn the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union largely disagree with that assessment. In the words of the ACLU (which is representing Carpenter), the government needs a “good reason” to access this data. Major tech companies, such as Google, Apple and Facebook, also think that the Fourth Amendment should apply to sensitive user data in order to line up “with people’s expectations of privacy in their digital data.”\n\nNow, the Supreme Court seems poised to render what will likely be the final judgment in the case — a decision that could set a precedent for digital privacy in the smartphone age.\n\nRead Next: Comcast’s ‘Commitment’ to Net Neutrality Comes Under Scrutiny', 'Supreme Court Will Decide If Privacy Rights Apply to Your Location Data', 0, 5.7);

And by logging every cell tower with which it connected, the cellphone plotted Davis and his accomplices’ retreat to New Jersey.\n\nThose cellphone records, obtained by prosecutors for Davis’ 2010 trial, disproved his alibi that he was at home the night of the killings and helped the Northampton County district attorney’s office secure a life sentence for the killer.\n\nFirst Deputy District Attorney Terence Houck, who led the prosecution, called cellphone data “the single most important piece of evidence you could get in any case.”\n\n“You can pick up 50 pieces of evidence against a person just by picking up their phone,” Houck said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices signaled in a case over law enforcement access to cellphone data that the abundance of personal information it contains might require police to show stronger evidence of criminal wrongdoing to get it.\n\nThat, in turn, might mean Pennsylvania authorities would be held to a higher standard to get court orders to obtain data from cellphone providers.\n\nBut Houck and Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said Wednesday they’re confident they would be able to meet that burden to get information that plays a role in cases ranging from drug trafficking to murder.\n\nCell tower data helped state police solve the missing person case of Holly Grim, who disappeared from her Lower Macungie Township home in 2013, and charge a Monroe County man last year with homicide in her death.\n\nSuch data also helped investigators identify and charge the alleged killers of two women whose bodies were found separately in Salisbury Township, Martin said.\n\n“It’s a very important law enforcement tool in a lot of cases,” Martin said.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania’s Wire Tap Act, which controls law enforcement access to intercepted telephone calls and other private communications, police must show and explain facts that support reasonable suspicion that telephone records contain evidence of a crime. That’s the same standard in a federal law under scrutiny in the Supreme Court in the appeal of a Michigan man serving a 116-year sentence for orchestrating armed robberies of cellphone stores.\n\nLawyers for Timothy Carpenter say authorities violated his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches. They argue police should be required to show probable cause rather than reasonable suspicion. The difference is that probable cause requires police to show facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe a search would reveal evidence of a crime, while reasonable suspicion requires police to show facts that would lead a trained and experienced police officer to believe there is evidence of a crime.\n\nThat additional burden wouldn’t be a stretch for local law enforcement, Martin and Houck both said. While Pennsylvania’s Wire Tap Act requires the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion, the evidence in any case could satisfy the tougher probable cause standard, Martin said. And in Northampton County, Houck said, police routinely obtain search warrants, which require them to meet the more stringent standards, rather than wire tap orders to get cellphone data.\n\nBut Houck said he understands why the Supreme Court chose to re-examine the standards for obtaining cellphone data.\n\n“It’s no surprise to me that there’s a battle about this because it just such a critical piece of evidence. It’s like a diary on every minute of your day,” Houck said.\n\nBut Martin said he disagrees with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who indicated sympathy toward Carpenter during Wednesday’s argument, noting that individual privacy is at stake and that more information will become available as technology advances.\n\n“If it assists people in committing crimes, it should also assist law enforcement in stopping them,” Martin said.\n\nThe Washington Post contributed to this story.\n\npeter.hall@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @phall215\n\n610-820-6581', 'Cellphone data under Supreme Court scrutiny crucial in solving local crimes', 0, 7.6),

Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, Civ. No. 16-712. The Court will decide whether inter partes reviews violate the U.S Constitution. Created by the American Invents Act of 2012, an inter partes review is an administrative process carried out by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which is an executive branch agency.\n\nThe dispute began when Oil States sued Greene’s Energy for infringement of Oil States’ hydraulic fracturing patent. In response, Greene’s Energy sought inter partes review, and the PTAB found the challenged claims to be unpatentable. Oil States challenged as unconstitutional the inter partes review system. According to Oil States, only courts in the judicial branch have the authority to invalidate patents. Therefore, Congress violated Article III of the Constitution when it authorized the PTAB’s Article I administrative judges to invalidate patents.\n\nIn response, Greene’s Energy argued that the inter partes review process is a streamlined and lower cost alternative to federal district court litigation. Likewise, the Solicitor General, on behalf of the government, defended the constitutionality of inter partes review because it allows the Patent Office to correct mistakes made during the initial examination process, and also to review the validity of a patent previously issued pursuant to constitutional Congressional authority.\n\nAt oral argument, Oil States maintained that, in a dispute between private parties over private rights, Congressional transfer of judicial power to an executive branch tribunal is improper without Article III supervision and consent. In turn, Greene’s Energy argued that inter partes review comports with Article III because the PTAB simply reexamines the propriety of the original grant of a patent, engaging in the same type of patentability analysis that Congress already entrusted to the Patent Office. Greene’s Energy also argued that the inter partes review process does not extinguish private property rights for patents where the standards of patentability were not met initially, such that the patent should not have issued in the first place.\n\nThe Justices questioned the difference between reexamination proceedings that have existed since 1980 and inter partes review that has existed only since 2012. Oil States answered that the reexamination procedure between an inventor and the government is different than an inter partes review between a patentee and a challenger which is adversarial in nature, and in which the executive branch, through the PTAB, has the power to determine invalidity.\n\nJustice Sotomayor questioned “whether the Patent Office has ‘unfettered discretion to take away that which it’s granted,’” especially when, for example, a patentee has come to rely on a patent’s existence as a private property right, upon which an investment and development of their business is based. Justice Roberts inquired about the fairness of inter partes review, especially for patents issued before the America Invents Act was even implemented.\n\nAnother issue arising during oral argument pertained to whether the selection of the PTAB judges on a particular panel could be “stacked” in favor of one party without any check on the administrative process, thus risking decision makers who could be subject to executive political influence.\n\nA prediction as to the outcome in Oil States is beyond the scope of this alert. A decision is expected by the end of the current term, which expires in June of 2018. In the meantime, we can expect that the questions and remarks by the Justices will be highly scrutinized for any signs of their forthcoming positions. The Court’s decision undoubtedly will have enormous ramifications that may disrupt the current patent system.\n\nLater in the day, the Supreme Court also heard oral arguments in SAS Inst., Inc. v. Matal, Civ. No. 16-969. Presumably dependent on the outcome in Oil States, the Court will decide whether section 318(a) of the Patent Act requires the PTAB to issue a final written decision as to every challenged claim, or rather allows the PTAB to issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of only some of the challenged patent claims, as the Federal Circuit held.', 'US Supreme Court Hears \"Oil States\" Oral Arguments Regarding Constitutionality of the Patent ...', -0.2, 8.3),

In 2011, the FBI was investigating a bunch of Radio Shack robberies around Detroit. Because agents suspected Carpenter of being a driver for this enterprise, they sought and obtained—without a warrant—what’s known as cell site location information to determine where he had been for a period of 127 days, placing his phone at 12,898 locations. Thanks to this information, he was sentenced to 116 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn response to Carpenter’s claim that tracking his movements using cellphone records violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free of warrantless government searches, the federal government argued that cellphone location data that was voluntarily turned over to third-party phone companies is not private. Indeed, a federal statute, the Stored Communications Act, allows the government to seek telecom information so long as it’s “relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.” That’s a standard far lower than the probable cause showing needed to get a warrant. Longstanding constitutional doctrine holds that once you turn over your personal papers and data to a third party, the government isn’t violating your privacy rights. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the government that this was not an unconstitutional search.\n\nArguing on behalf of Carpenter, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Nathan Wessler has to contend with the insistence of Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy that cellphone records are no more intrusive than bank records, which can be obtained without a warrant. Then Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and John Roberts all raise doubts about the ACLU’s contention that prosecutors should have to get a warrant once they are seeking more than 24 hours’ worth of location data.\n\nSotomayor highlights her concern about the intrusive nature of such searches, even if they last less than 24 hours: “Right now we’re only talking about the cell sites records, but as I understand it, a cellphone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor’s office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life. Presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you’re undressing.” Wessler calls these records a “time machine” that can be used to trace your every move.\n\nAlito asks Wessler to distinguish the two key cases, Smith v. Maryland (about the government scooping up phone numbers dialed from a home phone) and U.S. v. Miller (about the government scooping up banking records). Wessler replies that people aren’t voluntarily handing over their location information when they use their cellphones. Alito begs to differ: “Well, I mean, that’s a debatable empirical point whether people realize what’s going on. There’s reason to think maybe they do. I mean, people know, there were all these commercials, ‘Can you hear me now?,’ our company has lots of towers everywhere. What do they think that’s about?” He adds that the standard cellphone contract warns users that they can “disclose this information to the government if we get a court order.”\n\nThe dividing line at the court on cellphone privacy has less to do with ideology than with age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWessler replies that most Americans actually don’t know that this is what their service contract says. Kennedy asks why it isn’t best left to Congress to address the balance of interests, as legislators did with the Stored Communications Act. Kennedy and Wessler spar over whether reasonable people have an expectation of privacy in their cellphone data. Kennedy admits that he may not be the cellphone wizard here, but “if we have to make the judgment, it seems to me there’s a much more normal expectation that businesses have your cellphone data. I think everybody, almost everybody, knows that. If I know it, everybody does.” Laughter in the gallery.\n\nMichael Dreeben argues on behalf of the Trump solicitor general’s office, and he opens by claiming that the cell companies “function essentially as witnesses being asked to produce business records of their own transactions with customers.” He adds that the government is doing nothing more than “asking a business to provide information about the business\'s own transactions with a customer. And under the third-party doctrine, that does not implicate the Fourth Amendment rights of the customer.”\n\nThe chief justice stops him: “This is not simply created by the company, though. It’s a joint venture with the individual carrying the phone.”\n\nSotomayor tries to distinguish levels of intrusion: “Mr. Dreeben, why is it not OK, in the way we said about beepers, to plant a beeper in somebody’s bedroom, but it’s OK to get the cellphone records of someone who—I don’t, but I know that most young people have the phones in the bed with them.” Young people look uncomfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDreeben tells Sotomayor that the information sought here is not the contents of conversations but mere routing information. Justice Elena Kagan asks Dreeben to distinguish these facts from those in U.S. v. Jones, the 2012 GPS case in which Alito wrote on behalf of the majority that “society’s expectation has been that law enforcement and others would not—and indeed, in the main, simply could not—secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual’s car for a very long period.”\n\nDreeben replies that Jones “involved government surveillance. It involved attaching a GPS device to the car.” This case, by contrast, is about acquiring a provider’s business records. It is at this point that Justice Neil Gorsuch steps in on the side of the ACLU. He suggests that there is also a “property-based approach to privacy that has to be considered.” Then he and Dreeben interrupt one another for a lengthy period of time as Gorsuch demands that Dreeben stop fighting his hypothetical. Gorsuch demands that he concede that there is a property right here, and Dreeben says he refuses to concede to the “existence of a property right that resembles no property right that’s existed.” Now it’s the old people’s turn to look uncomfortable.\n\nDreeben insists again that there is an “element of voluntariness in signing up for a bank account and using a debit card to purchase everything in your life.” But the chief justice pushes back, citing Riley v. California, the cellphone privacy case in which the court found, as Roberts puts it, “that you really don’t have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone.”\n\nGorsuch will go on to thump away on his property rights argument, demanding of Dreeben whether the government can “generally acknowledge a property right but then strip it of any Fourth Amendment protection.” And Kagan will contend that writing off all intimate information as “third-party data” is basically just saying that all of “the other factors that you might think in a sensible world would matter to this question is trumped by the fact that the government is doing this by subpoena, rather than by setting up its own cell towers.”\n\nOther than Alito and Kennedy, it’s hard to find much sympathy for the government’s contention that all your location information is voluntarily surrendered to your carrier and contains nothing intimate about your life. In an intriguing way, the dividing line at the court on cellphone privacy has less to do with ideology than with age. Sotomayor may not take her iPhone to bed with her, but both Gorsuch and Kagan clearly know people who do. Ginsburg is basically 32 at heart, and Justice Stephen Breyer—waxing metaphysical on Wednesday about the geographic location of one’s physical body—proves that privacy is sufficiently meta to be everywhere and nowhere. The government seems content to let Congress figure this out or wait and see whether more cellphone towers might make us more free in the future. Happily, the majority of the court seems to recognize that the Framers would no more want AT&T to root through your papers and hand them to the government than they would want the government to do such a thing itself.', 'Can You Track Me Now?', -0.1, 21.6),

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\nWTVO/WQRF-TV - Attorneys for the Illinois Child Support Specialist who is suing his own union, AFSCME, have filed their first brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in a case which could potentially significantly change the relationship between state government and public employee unions.\n\nIn Janus vs. AFSCME, which will be heard in the U.S. Supreme Court\'s next term, Mark Janus claims that he opposes many of the positions for which his union advocates and therefore does not wish to be forced to pay for union representation he does not want. AFSCME argues that Janus benefits from their negotiations on behalf of all state workers they represent and therefore should be forced to pay union dues.\n\nThe case\'s repercussions could be significant for the power of public employee unions nationwide, not just in Illinois. Should the Supreme Court side with Janus, the impact would likely be to significantly weaken the finances of public employee unions since potentially millions of government workers could opt-out of paying union dues, especially if they personally disagree with the union\'s political activities..\n\n“Forced union fees remain the largest regime of compelled speech in the nation,\" said Mark Mix, President of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation in a statement. \"... we are hopeful that in the coming months the Supreme Court will correct this anomaly in First Amendment jurisprudence by striking down all mandatory union payments for public workers.\"\n\nAFSCME says however that all public employees will be hurt if the Supreme Court sides with Janus. \"When working people are able to join strong unions, they have the strength in numbers they need to fight for the freedoms they deserve, like access to quality health care, retirement security and time off work to care for a loved one,” said AFSCME Pres. Lee Saunders in a statement when the Supreme Court decided to take up the case.\n\nThere is a political element to the case. Janus is being represented by attorneys provided by conservative groups who feel public employee unions have become too powerful in electing more liberal public officials. Those officials in turn they say are more likely to grant wage and benefit concessions to the union in return for its continued political support.\n\nAFSCME has been especially combative with Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, who has attempted to limit pay and benefit increases among other changes for workers represented by the union while the state grapples with a financial crisis. AFSCME contends the governor has not negotiated in good faith, leading to Gov. Rauner declaring an impasse which is being challenged in court, and the union authorizing a strike.\n\nThe current makeup of the court also appears to favor Janus over AFSCME, especially with the confirmation earlier this year of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. However, AFSCME can claim that past rulings by the high court better support their position.\n\nOral arguments are expected to be held in February.', 'Supreme Court Case Against Forced AFSCME Union Dues Moves Forward', -0.1, 4.4),

Who do we talk to? What do we read about?\n\nOur mobile phones are troves of personal, private information, and the US Supreme Court weighed Wednesday how easily police should be able to get it.\n\nIn a case seen as a landmark for privacy protection in the digital age, the court heard arguments over whether, police have the right to obtain the location data of a person\'s phone from providers without a search warrant.\n\nDuring the hearing, most of the high court\'s nine justices appeared deeply concerned about how phone companies can track a person\'s movements via their device and hand that information, sometimes going back years, to police when asked.\n\nCivil libertarians say that information is protected by the US Constitution.\n\nBut law enforcement officials say the location data transmitted from a phone to a cell tower has been essentially made public and handed over to a third party, giving up any claim the owner might have to privacy.\n\nThe specific case involves Timothy Carpenter, who was tracked down and convicted of theft in 2011 after the police obtained some 12,898 cell tower location points for Carpenter\'s device over four months from phone companies.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor appeared to agree with the pro-privacy advocates.\n\nThe cell phone \"is an appendage now for some people,\" she noted.\n\n\"Right now we\'re only talking about the cell site records, but as I understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in your bedroom.

It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life -- presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you\'re undressing.\"\n\n- Constitutional test case -\n\nThe US Constitution\'s Fourth Amendment guarantees the privacy of citizens from \"unreasonable searches and seizures,\" and says police must obtain warrants based on \"probable cause\" if they want to search a suspect\'s \"persons, houses, papers, and effects.\"\n\nParties on both sides of the case agree that the law did not anticipate an era in which everyone relies on a cell phone and technology providers can amass data on a person via those phones.\n\nNathan Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union representing Carpenter, said the police collection of the phone location data constituted a \"search\" that required a warrant.\n\n\"The concern here is with the privacy invasion, which is quite severe over the long term, over these more than four months of data,\" he told the court.\n\nBut the government argues that the location data is not like tapping a phone conversation, which is illegal without a warrant.\n\n\"We\'re dealing here with routing information. We\'re not dealing with the contents of communications,\" argued Michael Dreeben, deputy solicitor general for the Department of Justice.\n\nHe argued that giving up the information is a voluntary act by the cell phone user, and so it is not protected.\n\n\"There is an element here of voluntariness in deciding to contract with a cell company, just like there\'s an element of voluntariness in getting a landline phone and making a call,\" Dreeben told the court.\n\n- Implications for private data -\n\nThe case has much broader implications than cell phone location data, experts say.\n\nToday, a huge amount of information from people\'s lives is held by \"third parties\": personal files stored in the internet cloud, information from home electronics collected by the makers of those appliances, and communications sent via cell phones and the internet.\n\n\"The advance of technology means that information you used to store in your desk drawer is now stored somewhere with third parties,\" said Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy & Technology.\n\nTo get information in a drawer, he noted, police would have to ask the court for a warrant.\n\nThe Supreme Court will likely make a decision on the case before the end of its current term in June 2018.', 'Police vs privacy: US Supreme Court looks at cell phone tracking', 0, 8.1),

Of all the people in the courtroom — the judge, the prosecutor, potential jurors and his own attorney — only one, Juror No. 15, is black like him.\n\nBut then, the Spokane County prosecutor handling the case dismisses Juror No. 15, using the power of the \"peremptory challenge,\" a rule that allows lawyers for both sides to eliminate potential jurors without an explanation. For centuries, prosecutors have used this rule to stack the deck against people accused of crimes.\n\nIn the landmark 1986 U.S. Supreme Court case Batson v. Kentucky, the court ruled that it\'s unconstitutional to exclude a juror based on race and established a three-step test to make jury selection a more just process. Thus far, what\'s now known as the \"Batson test\" has almost completely failed, judges and legal scholars say. And discrimination has festered.\n\n\"Unless you\'re a complete idiot, there\'s no reason you should get hung up by Batson,\" says Salvador Mungia, a Tacoma attorney who had a hand in writing the ACLU of Washington\'s proposed revisions for jury selection. \"The bottom line is, Batson doesn\'t work. People are being prevented from serving on juries simply because of the color of their skin.\"\n\nStudies have found that prosecutors throughout the country use peremptory challenges to eliminate black jurors two to three times as often as people of other races. In Washington state, appeals courts have vacated only two convictions based on the \"Batson test,\" according to state Supreme Court documents.\n\nThe Spokane case, while not an especially egregious example, offers a window into attempts in Washington state to rid jury selection of prejudice.\n\nThis year, the state Supreme Court tried to sharpen the \"Batson test\" for Washington state courts, though some argue the court did not go far enough.\n\nStill, the new rules gave Cook\'s attorney, Jeremy Schmidt, a stronger case to cry foul when Juror No. 15 was sent home earlier this month.\n\nSpokane Superior Court Judge Julie McKay called a mistrial — a rarity in these cases — though she stopped short of ruling that the prosecutor was racially biased.\n\nBoth Judge McKay and the prosecutor, Preston McCollam, declined to comment for this article because the case against Cook is still pending.\n\nSchmidt emphasizes that he does not believe the prosecutor is racist, but he says he had an ethical duty to raise the issue. By doing so, Schmidt forced a difficult conversation about implicit racial discrimination.\n\n\"There\'s nothing that flies against our justice system as much as racism,\" Schmidt says. \"We have this idea of due process and of looking at an individual based on the evidence and not anyone\'s preconceived notions.\"\n\nclick to enlarge Public defender Jeremy Schmidt: \"There\'s nothing that flies against our justice system as much as racism.\"\n\nIn 1982, a Louisville, Kentucky, man by the name of James Batson was accused of a burglary he says he didn\'t commit. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The only holdout, Batson recently recounted on the podcast More Perfect, was a black woman, who believed he was innocent. She told him as much after the trial, he says on the podcast.\n\nDuring the second trial, the prosecutor used \"peremptory challenges\" to eliminate all four black people from the jury pool.\n\nHe was then convicted by the all-white jury and sentenced to 20 years in prison. But in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated Batson\'s conviction, and established the three-step \"Batson test\" to protect against racial discrimination in the future.\n\nThe test works like this: First a lawyer for one side must show the judge that, at first blush, a \"peremptory challenge\" looks to be racially motivated. Typically, that has meant showing a pattern of racial discrimination. The dismissal of a single juror wouldn\'t necessarily cut it. (The state Supreme Court\'s ruling this year changes that; now, if a lawyer dismisses the only juror of a particular racial group, you automatically move on to the second step.)\n\nNext, the other side must provide a \"race-neutral\" explanation for why a particular juror could not be impartial. In the past, those reasons have included distrust of law enforcement, living in a high-crime neighborhood, having a child outside of marriage and speaking English as a second language. One U.S. Supreme Court decision from 1995 even said it was OK for judges to accept \"silly or superstitious\" reasons, such as \"curly, unkempt hair,\" and \"a mustache and goatee type beard.\"\n\nFinally, it\'s up to the judge to decide whether the lawyer intentionally discriminated based on race. This final step essentially requires a judge to call the lawyer a racist or sexist.\n\n\"That is a fundamental flaw in the Batson standard,\" says Mungia, the Tacoma attorney. \"For me to make the challenge, I have to say the lawyer struck a juror for a discriminatory purpose, and then to sustain my challenge, the judge has to be the bad guy and find a discriminatory purpose. That\'s a very harsh thing to find.\"\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court first created the three-step test, then-Justice Thurgood Marshall warned that it would not be strong enough to root out explicit, much less implicit, bias.\n\nMarshall argued that the \"peremptory challenge\" should be eliminated. Current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and Washington State justices Steven Gonzalez and Mary Yu have since joined in that thinking.\n\nWithin months of the 1986 decision, lawyers began learning how to pass the \"Batson test.\" One infamous lesson from a prosecutor in Philadelphia still lives on YouTube.\n\nDuring an hourlong lecture, Jack McMahon stands in front of a room full of young prosecutors. He instructs them to ask more questions of black people during jury selection \"so it gives you more ammunition to make an articulable reason as to why you\'re striking them not for race.\"\n\nSince 1986, courts have expanded the \"Batson test\" to include discrimination based on sex, ethnicity and, in some states, sexual orientation. But peremptory challenges are still the rule, and the American justice system is still reckoning with them.\n\nStudies have shown that even one black juror can make a difference. Research from Duke University in 2012 found that all-white juries convict black defendants 16 percent more often than white defendants. The study drawing from 700 felony trials over 10 years in Florida concluded that adding even one black juror eliminates that gap.\n\nIn court, McCollam, the prosecutor in the Spokane case, cited one conversation with Juror No. 15, as well as the man\'s reaction to answers from other jurors, as reasons for dismissing him.\n\nThe prosecutor noted that Juror No. 15 said \"eyewitnesses get it wrong,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\n\"I didn\'t feel like that was an actual answer to the questions that were posed or gave anything meaningful to the discussion, and I didn\'t choose to follow up on it at that time,\" McCollam told the judge.\n\nMcCollam also recalled that Juror No. 15 \"appeared to be nodding in assent\" as another juror described the anxiety invoked when stopped by police.\n\nTypically, a mistrial in these cases requires the judge to determine that the lawyer dismissed a juror based on race. Although Judge McKay did declare a mistrial in the case against Cook — he\'s been charged with felony witness tampering — she stopped short of calling McCollam racially biased because there was not enough information in the record to do so, says Schmidt, the defense attorney.\n\nRather, Schmidt says, the judge ruled in an \"abundance of caution,\" and in light of this year\'s state Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"We need these types of actions to take place, as far as calling a mistrial,\" says Mungia, the Tacoma attorney. \"It\'s saying that we\'re going to make sure we\'re not infecting the outcome of a trial.\"\n\nThis year, Mungia helped write the ACLU of Washington\'s suggested changes to jury selection rules. The proposal would eliminate the requirement that judges call a lawyer racially biased. Instead, judges should decide from the perspective of an \"objective observer,\" according to the proposed rules.\n\nThe ACLU\'s proposal also suggests that previous interaction with the police, living in \"high-crime\" neighborhoods, receiving welfare benefits and speaking English as a second language, should not be accepted as \"race-neutral\" reasons for excusing jurors, as they have been in the past.\n\nThe Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys opposes those suggestions, saying in part that they\'re \"slanted to require the State to seat jurors who are biased against the State\'s witness,\" according to a letter from the association.\n\nFor years, the Washington State Supreme Court has been vocal about the threat peremptory challenges pose. Thus far, two state Supreme Court justices have said they must go.\n\n\"The time has come to abolish peremptory challenges,\" Justice Gonzalez writes in a 2013 opinion. \"The use of this procedure propagates racial discrimination, contributes to the historical and ongoing underrepresentation of minority groups on juries.\"\n\nDespite growing support, Mungia and other attorneys believe they serve an essential purpose.\n\nBy eliminating peremptory challenges, the power to decide who sits on the jury shifts from the defendant to the judge. The only other way to remove a juror is with a \"for-cause challenge,\" where a judge decides if a juror can be impartial.\n\n\"Peremptory challenges allow both sides to get rid of the extreme people on either end of the spectrum, who may be biased, but not in a way that would get them off the jury panel,\" Mungia says. \"They allow your clients to have some say in the 12 people who are deciding their fate. We should continue that purpose, but not at the expense of keeping people from serving because of race or ethnicity.\" ♦', 'Of His Peers', -0.2, 33.4);

This one will decide whether any common business vendor – a restaurant, a hotel, a taxicab – selling products or services to the public can refuse to sell or accommodate LGBT people by simply claiming to have a religious belief hostile to such people.\n\nIn Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado, a baker who prepares elaborate cakes for wedding receptions says that the mere act of selling any of his cakes for the reception of a same-sex couple amounts to \"participating\" in and supporting the wedding. The baker, Jack Phillips, claims to have a religious belief that opposes allowing marriage for same-sex couples. And he says that participating in a same-sex couple\'s reception conflicts with that religious belief and his rights as an artist to create what he wants to create.\n\nThe case is one of the most-watched cases before the U.S. Supreme Court this session because a ruling in favor of the baker would enable just about any business to refuse service to just about any patron by claiming a religious hostility to that patron or a creative license to refuse service.\n\nThe Masterpiece Cakeshop case is the only argument the court will hear Tuesday. Here are some of the facts and issues to keep in mind as a flood of media coverage ensues.\n\nWhen and where\n\nThe argument will take place from 7 to 8 a.m. (Pacific time), at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Seating for the public is very limited, and people interested in standing in the very long lines to get in often must arrive (or arrange for line-sitters) the day before the argument. However, audio recordings of major cases, such as this one, are usually available on the court\'s website within a few hours of adjournment. And transcripts of the argument are also available on the same day on the court\'s transcript page.\n\nThe laws in question\n\nThe case essentially pits a state law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in public accommodations against a federal law (the First Amendment to the Constitution) forbidding laws \"prohibiting the free exercise of religion\" or \"abridging the freedom of speech.\" The state law in this case is Colorado\'s, but 20 other states have laws to prevent discrimination against LGBT people. And all states have laws prohibiting discrimination based on race, sex, and other factors. The Colorado law, like those of most other states, exempts any entity \"principally used for religious purposes.\"\n\nThe person challenging the state law\n\nThe aforementioned Phillips, a \"cake artist\" and owner of the Masterpiece Cake bakery in a Denver suburb, refused to sell a cake to a same-sex couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, because \"the Bible teaches [same-sex marriage is] not an OK thing. According to a Heritage Foundation publication, Phillips \"belongs to a Baptist-rooted church.\" Phillips said his personal religious beliefs and his artistic sensibility prevented him from selling a wedding cake to the couple for their wedding reception.\n\nThe couple challenging discrimination\n\nCraig and Mullins are a gay couple living in Colorado. They were married in Massachusetts in 2012, when the U.S. Supreme Court had not yet struck down state bans against marriage for same-sex couples (in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015). After Phillips refused to sell them a cake for their reception, Mullins posted an account of the interaction on his Facebook page and urged friends to let the bakery \"know you feel their policy is discriminatory,\" reported the Denver Post. That prompted media attention and alerted the couple that the action violated state law. So they filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.\n\nThe muddle\n\nPhillips and his lawyers at the Alliance Defending Freedom have tried to shift the focus away from religious-based discrimination to the idea that laws should not dictate to \"artists\" what projects they create. On a June 2017 episode of the talk show \"The View,\" Phillips said he would sell the same-sex couple \"anything\" in his store but not a wedding cake. \"It\'s not turning them away, it\'s just this event,\" he said. He later claimed, \"I\'m not judging these two gay men that came in, I\'m just trying to preserve my right as an artist to decide which artistic endeavors to do and which I\'m not.\" The same-sex couple did not get a chance to ask Phillips to create an artistic endeavor just for them. He refused them service within \"30 seconds\" or in \"less than two minutes,\" according to his own accounts of the interaction. And Phillips\' website illustrates that most of the wedding cake designs he offers are neither religiously oriented nor include a male-female image.\n\nThe state\'s action\n\nA state administrative judge, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and the Colorado Court of Appeals all ruled against Phillips. The commission did not order Phillips to design cakes for same-sex weddings, as Phillips claims, but rather it ordered that he stop \"refusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [the baker] would sell to heterosexual couples.\"\n\nChief arguments by baker\n\nThe state law violates two First Amendment rights: free exercise of religion and freedom of speech. Phillips argues that his Christian beliefs oppose same-sex marriage and that the work he puts into baking cakes and his selling them for various events amount to speech or \"expression.\"\n\nChief response by civil rights groups\n\nLawyers supporting the state law say the religious-based arguments here are recycled from the 1960s, when opponents of laws prohibiting discrimination based on race argued that it violated their religious beliefs to serve black customers in the same space as white customers. (See Newman v. Piggie Park case.) And they say the artistic expression arguments misidentify who the real \"speaker\" is in the marketplace; it is the buyer, who says, \"I will accept this product\" or \"I support this work.\"\n\nPossible narrow ruling\n\nThat Phillips\' religious beliefs might be implicated whenever he creates a custom-design cake for a couple (rather than when he sells them a cake with an existing design).\n\nAttorney for the baker\n\nKristen Waggoner is head of the legal team of the Alliance Defending Freedom, an organization that has devoted much of its time and resources to challenging laws that prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. She is a graduate of television evangelical Pat Robertson\'s Regent University School of Law.\n\nAttorney for the US\n\nThe Trump administration has taken sides with the baker. It is sending Solicitor General Noel Francisco to argue their point. Francisco took office in mid-September of this year. A graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, he clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. He was an associate counsel to President George W. Bush and served in that administration\'s Department of Justice.\n\nAttorney for Colorado\n\nColorado Solicitor General Frederick Yarger will defend the state\'s law before the Supreme Court. Yarger has held his post for two years. He clerked for Timothy Tymkovich of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit and has argued two other cases before the Supreme Court, both in 2016.\n\nAttorney for the gay couple\n\nRepresenting the gay couple will be American Civil Liberties Union national legal director David Cole, a longtime advocate for equal protection of the law for LGBT people and people with HIV.\n\nHistoric note\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a voter-approved law in Colorado that sought to exempt everyone from local ordinances that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation ( Romer v. Evans).\n\nPostscript\n\nThe Supreme Court will discuss in conference Friday, December 1, a public accommodations case involving anti-LGBT sentiment in another business transaction. Arlene\'s Flowers v. Washington involves a florist who did not want to sell flowers for the wedding of a same-sex couple. Like the baker in Colorado, the florist in Washington state lost at the state supreme court and filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, a week before the Colorado case. Chances are the court will re-list the case and decide its fate after argument in the Masterpiece case. But they will not likely tip their hand on Arlene\'s Flowers until they release their ruling on Masterpiece Cake – which could be as late as June.', 'Cake case could allow businesses to refuse LGBTs', -0.1, 24),

The biological mother of the child said that her ex-wife had legal avenues open to her to bolster her parental rights during a divorce proceeding, but failed to pursue them.\n\nNow Mississippi’s nine justices must sort out those positions, in a case that could also affect opposite-sex couples who use someone else’s eggs, sperm or both to conceive a child.\n\nChristina “Chris” Strickland, a 44-year-old Pearl resident, wants to be listed as the legal parent of Zayden Strickland, who bears her name, hoping to ultimately gain equal custody. Rankin County Chancery Court Judge John Grant ruled that the unknown sperm donor who fathered Zayden in an in-vitro procedure, has parental rights. He awarded sole custody to Kimberly Day, who bore Zayden. Attorney Beth Littell told the justices they should reverse the judge’s ruling.\n\n“This child really needs to have a legal relationship to both people who brought him into the world and who he knows and understands to be his only parents, not some anonymous sperm donor,” Littrell argued.\n\nStrickland has said she wanted the hospital where Zayden was born to list her as a parent on the birth certificate, but said the hospital refused, citing Mississippi state law at the time.\n\n“Christina should have been recognized on the birth certificate at the time. That was an unconstitutional law that prevented that from happening and shouldn’t be used to justify claiming that she’s not a parent now.”\n\nBut lawyer Prentiss Grant, arguing for Day, said that sperm and egg donors do have legal rights and that when a child is conceived through artificial means, a second parent is more akin to someone who is adopting a child.\n\n“This is basically a middle situation where we have a marital unit but we do not have a biological connection,” Grant said.\n\nHe said the court should back the judge’s ruling that Strickland has to persuade a judge to legally terminate the sperm donor’s rights. He told justices that Strickland shouldn’t benefit from the legal presumption that the children born in a marriage between a man and a woman belong to both. Grant said Strickland “knew from the beginning that she was not the parent of the child.”\n\nThe case is being closely watched by both gay-rights activists and groups aiding in vitro fertilization. A ruling in Day’s favor could mean that opposite-sex couples who use someone else’s eggs or sperm would have to terminate donors’ rights as well to achieve legal status.\n\nSome cases elsewhere support Strickland. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered Arkansas earlier this year to put the names of two women as parents on birth certificates, saying same-sex couples must get “the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage.” And the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that married same-sex couples should get the same presumption of parentage as opposite-sex couples.\n\nChris Strickland has visitation rights and pays child support, but Littrell said she has a “much inferior status” to legal parenthood.

Be sure to write us at letters@dailysignal.com.—Ken McIntyre\n\nDear Daily Signal: Very nice job on the Jack Phillips video (“After Declining to Make a Wedding Cake, He’s Going to the Supreme Court. Here’s How That Journey Challenged His Faith“). I have been a supporter of Mr. Phillips—at least in prayers—for a couple of years.\n\nOnce, prior to the Colorado Court of Appeals decision, I mailed Jack a card encouraging his efforts and along with a small check to help with his legal costs. He actually mailed back to me a handwritten thank-you card with several encouraging sentiments.\n\nI know, since I’m a thank-you card writer myself, that the card took Jack several minutes of his time to write, address, and mail. Given his obvious busyness, that really impressed me.\n\nI hope that Masterpiece Cakeshop’s Supreme Court case goes well. I really believe that his fight is a fight for all of us who seek to live out the Christian faith as we are told to do, according to the scriptures.\n\nThank you for highlighting Jack Phillips’ story. For me, it will be a reminder to pray for him during the next few days.—David Hughes\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop’s owner, Jack Phillips, has the right to do business with whom he wants. It is rather hypocritical of two men in a same-sex relationship—who demand the right to their lifestyle and beliefs—to adamantly impose their views on Mr. Phillips.\n\nThat couple should have found another business to make a custom cake for their wedding, and left this man alone.—Leila Martin\n\n***\n\nShould a gay couple be compelled to cater an anti-gay luncheon at a local church? Freedom of association cuts both ways. This case is about protecting everyone’s right to it.\n\nNo one should be compelled to serve another. When one is denied service, he is free to take his business elsewhere, open up a competing business, protest, or boycott. Period.—Pete Conde\n\n***\n\nThank you for Kelsey Harkness’ masterful video piece on Jack Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop, surely one of your best. May the Holy Spirit go with them to the Supreme Court and beyond. —John Sowder\n\nIt’s a simple thing: If I own the company, I decide who my customers are. When did we lose such a freedom? It’s so basic there’s no need to mention the First Amendment. When we can’t choose our customers, we’ve lost freedom at the most elemental level.—Chip Henry\n\n***\n\nThe same-sex couple in Colorado easily could have purchased a cake elsewhere than from Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, but seemingly wanted to share with the world a hatred for this man’s difference of opinion.\n\nPray that this stronghold is defeated in the Supreme Court, because we deal not with flesh and blood, but powers and principalities.\n\nWe also are seeing society’s great cowardice in its unwillingness to take a traditional moral stance.—Linda Berch\n\n***\n\nThank you, Jack Phillips, for sharing your story with The Daily Signal. I really think God’s hand chose you to work out this little problem. God is in control, and though you may not win the Supreme Court case, God has a plan.—Nancy Barnes\n\n***\n\nWin or lose his case in the Supreme Court, Jack Phillips will have won because he is right in the eyes of God. Although needed, governments are not always right or just. This is a case in point. Thank you, Mr. Phillips, for letting God work through you.—Lee McLaughlin\n\n***\n\nThe case in which the owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop must defend their rights is yet another sign that this once great nation is gravely ill. When man’s law takes precedence over God’s law, there can be only one outcome.\n\nOpposing judges and lawyers are quite willing to throw God’s law under the bus, but what will they do when they stand in final judgment before the eternal judge? You can bet they will want to plea-bargain, which will not be possible.

Stand firm in your beliefs and God will see you through this storm.—Gail Hawke\n\n***\n\nSorry, people, this is a left-wing strategy to force businesses to follow the left’s belief system, no matter one’s view.\n\nThe couple who sued Jack Phillips under Colorado’s anti-discrimination law had every right to look for a gay baker to make their wedding cake. But no, they chose Jack Phillips as an example of the couple’s doctrine and to punish this man’s business.\n\nHopefully the Supreme Court will see through the couple’s motivations and consider the lower court’s decision an injustice.—Louis Bontya ll\n\n***\n\nWho would have thought that there would be such hatred, persecution, and discrimination against a lovely guy like this, just because he has the moral integrity and strength of character to stand up for his Christian beliefs? But Jesus said it would happen in the last days, so I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised.—Barbara Holland\n\n***\n\nWhat an example Jack Phillips and his daughter are, especially when our pathetic society is screaming wrong.

That does not mean, however, that every “religion” under the sun is legitimate.\n\nFreedom of religion should not be interpreted to grant Satan worshipers or death-cult worshipers or other such destructive influences equal standing. The Supreme Court must get this one right.—Randy and Peggy Malcolm\n\n***\n\nWill this baker be refusing to make wedding cakes for couples embarking on their second marriage? What if their first marriage ended due to adultery?\n\nPicking and choosing which “sin” to discriminate against seems very unchristian to me. As well as very difficult to justify.—C.A. Summers\n\n***\n\nNobody is forcing him to bake cakes for people. What they are requiring, however, is that if he holds himself out to the public as a cake baker, he cannot refuse to bake cakes for people just because he chooses not to approve of their lifestyle. If he doesn’t like it, he should stop baking cakes.—Adam Hodkinv\n\nA large group of political officials back the Colorado Christian cake artist in support of his #1A rights https://t.co/0AJeOpiUQR @DailySignal — Free Speech HQ (@FreeSpeechHQ) December 1, 2017\n\nPublic Officials Support Masterpiece Cakeshop Owner\n\nDear Daily Signal: As for the commentary by Amy Swearer, Meagan Devlin, and Kaitlyn Finley, when you cut through all of this legal mumbo-jumbo, it all boils down to one question—do we have religious freedom or not (“This Large Group of Public Officials Backs a Christian Baker’s First Amendment Rights“)? The left thinks not, and not only demands that we agree, but that we like it as well.—Randy Leyendecker\n\n***\n\nI have said this many times: The legal argument is all wrong. The man is an artist. If you want a cake, go to Costco, if you want art, go commission it from a guy like him. We do not force artists to make art against their will. The same goes for other artists, like photographers, planners, or decorators. What they do is very subjective and unique to them.—Ron Stapley\n\n***\n\nGreat article.

But their reasons for supporting the baker are made of stupid nonsense.\n\nYes, baking a decorative cake is “expression.” The very act of refusing to bake the cake is also expression. Plus, one should not need the “excuse” of expression to be able to practice basic liberty and oppose tyranny.—Jerome Waldemar\n\n***\n\nThe choice to enter into a gay union somewhat like a marriage and the choice to enter, or not, into an artistic endeavor such as creating and baking a cake in support of that union are both in and of themselves protected by the First Amendment.\n\nHowever, a gay union is still not a marriage and is not addressed in any portion of the Constitution. And refusing to support it being termed a marriage in any way with cakes or otherwise, based on religious grounds, remains a First Amendment guarantee.—Steve Fowler\n\n***\n\nThis is in no way a violation of First Amendment rights at all. It’s not about the cake, it’s about law. While you have the right to believe, you do not have the right to subject others to your belief, period, and the law cannot consider your beliefs. The Constitution does not consider anyone’s actual beliefs. If so we would have chaos in the streets.\n\nWe would have people beating women and stealing and murdering and getting by with it for simply saying ,”It is my belief.” That’s the problem here. Discrimination is illegal. The law cannot and will not consider the existence of a God or any actual beliefs.—Jerry Kopp\n\n***\n\nAfter prevailing at the Supreme Court, Mr. Phillips should change the verbiage on the sign in his place of business that reads “gluten free” to “government free.”—Tom Subler\n\n***\n\nEdible art.

Chris Christie says he\'s cautiously optimistic about the state\'s chances at next week\'s Supreme Court oral arguments on legalizing sports betting. Other states are poised to offer sports gambling if the court sides with New Jersey. (Dec. 1) AP\n\nThe Supreme Court takes up a case Monday that could decide the future of legal sports betting in the United States. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gambled big-time five years ago when he signed a law authorizing sports betting at casinos and racetracks and dared anyone to \"try to stop us.\"\n\nThat\'s exactly what college and professional sports leagues and the federal government have done, thanks to a succession of court rulings upholding a 25-year-old federal law that prohibits gambling on sports outside Nevada and three other states with small sports lotteries.\n\nBut Christie has one last shot before leaving office next month. The Supreme Court on Monday will hear oral arguments in his case and could decide, as many court-watchers predict, that the ban violates states\' rights. Such a ruling could open the floodgates to sports betting in any state willing to regulate it.\n\nIt\'s not often that the high court tackles a case with so much weighty drama -- not just sports and gambling, but a classic constitutional battle between the federal government and the states over the 225-year-old system of government known as federalism.\n\n“To use a gambling term, it’s a trifecta,” Paul Clement, the attorney representing the NCAA and pro sports leagues, said recently.\n\nClement will face off Monday against Theodore Olson, his former boss in the U.S. solicitor general\'s office. Olson headed the office for the first three years of President George W. Bush\'s tenure and was followed by Clement for the next four years. Together they have argued nearly 150 cases at the court.\n\nThe two gladiators will tangle over the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), passed by Congress in 1992 to preserve what lawmakers felt was the integrity of the games. Sponsored by former senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat who once played small forward for the New York Knicks, the law preceded the advent and growth of Internet gambling.\n\nBecause Nevada had legalized sports betting in 1949, it was grandfathered in, and the state now handles nearly $5 billion annually. Delaware, Montana and Oregon were allowed to keep previously authorized sports lotteries. Other states were given a year\'s leeway to get in on the action, but even New Jersey failed to take advantage of the offer.\n\nNow even Delaware, which has a leg up on 46 states by virtue of its complicated \"parlay\" betting involving three or more National Football League games, is watching its neighbor\'s Supreme Court case with great interest. The state\'s handle has risen each year since 2009 but topped out last year at $46 million -- just 1% of Nevada\'s take.\n\n“If we could bet on all sports and not just football, and make all kinds of wagers and not just parlay wagers … we would make out better in the long run,” said Vernon Kirk, director of the Delaware Lottery.\n\n\'Mom and apple pie\'\n\nSuper Bowl proposition bets are displayed on a board at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook race and sports book in Las Vegas. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nThe Congress that passed PASPA with only five dissents thought it was keeping college and professional sports free from the taint of gambling, with its connection to organized crime. That hasn\'t proven true. Today, illegal sports betting in the United States is a $150 billion business -- nearly 10% of which is bet on the Super Bowl and the NCAA\'s \"March Madness\" college basketball tournament.\n\n\"Far from stopping sports betting, PASPA has just moved it into the shadows, all while Americans\' views on the matter have evolved,\" the American Gaming Association argues in legal papers. The group cites polling that shows 85% of Americans now view casino gambling as acceptable.\n\nAnd unlike 1992, most states as well as tribal nations have the infrastructure to support sports betting at casinos and racetracks. Forty states have more than 1,000 casinos supporting 1.7 million jobs. Forty-eight states have lotteries.\n\nThe Casino at Delaware Park in Wilmington is one of three locations in the state where bettors can wager on NFL games. Given its proximity to New Jersey, it\'s not surprising that some of the customers head south on game days.\n\n“We’re definitely in position if the Supreme Court shot down PASPA,\" said Kevin DeLucia, senior vice president of finance at Delaware Park. \"We already have a law on the books in the state of Delaware that we can do it.”\n\nThe sports leagues remain opposed, at least in principle, to easing or erasing the federal law\'s rules. The brief submitted by the NCAA and the four major pro sports leagues quoted from a Senate report in 1992 that considered the attraction of new state revenue but concluded that \"the risk to the reputation of one of our nation\'s most popular pastimes ... is not worth it.\"\n\nHowever, in the decades since the legislation was passed, the National Hockey League has located a team in Las Vegas, and the NFL\'s Oakland Raiders are due to follow. National Basketball Association commissioner Adam Silver has endorsed sports betting, and Major League Baseball has invested in fantasy leagues.\n\nWhile the federal government stands behind the law, the most vocal opposition is coming from an eclectic mix of Christian and Muslim religious groups and others promoting public health and economic justice. In legal papers, they argue that state-regulated betting on sports will harm young people, low-income households and others who become addicted.\n\nSports gambling is \"a regressive tax on the least fortunate people in society, and it often takes advantage of addiction,\" Deepak Gupta, the lawyer representing the groups, said. \"Some members of the court may be concerned about unleashing the specter of unregulated, commercial gambling throughout the nation.”\n\nBut the number of groups that are backing New Jersey in its quest far outnumbers the other side. They include 18 states led by West Virginia, the National Governors Association, and Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., who is sponsoring legislation that would strike down the federal ban if the high court doesn\'t.\n\n“At the end of the day, in the long run, I expect to see sports betting all across the country,” says Geoff Freeman, president of the American Gaming Association. \"The concept of betting on sports in this country is mom and apple pie.\"\n\nFederal power, states\' rights\n\nOutgoing New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie could win big on sports betting at the Supreme Court. (Photo: Julio Cortez, AP)\n\nTo get there, proponents have to convince the justices that the federal law runs afoul of the 10th Amendment, which reserves for the states all powers not delegated to the federal government.\n\nTo date, federal courts have upheld the law -- even after New Jersey repealed its own prohibition on sports betting in hopes of circumventing a previous negative ruling.\n\nTo the Garden State, that\'s a violation of the \"anti-commandeering\" principle established by Supreme Court precedent. The federal government, it says, cannot force the state to do something against its will.\n\n\"A federal court, purporting to enforce federal law, now is dictating the contents of New Jersey\'s state law concerning sports wagering,\" the state argues, using its preferred term for bettors\' activities. (By contrast, the sports leagues and federal government call it \"gambling.\")\n\nStates aligned with New Jersey argue that such a ruling from the Supreme Court could extend to other issues in the future, from gun control and physician-assisted suicide to the regulation of self-driving cars.\n\nBut the sports leagues say to comply with PASPA, New Jersey and other states simply must do ... nothing. The law prohibits sports betting operations by states and third parties but does not require them to take any affirmative action whatsoever.\n\n\"New Jersey complied with PASPA for two decades,\" their brief says, \"without doing anything at all.\"\n\nMore: Supreme Court faces blockbuster term -- and Trump\n\nMore: Fans have fantasy sports, Supreme Court nerds have FantasySCOTUS\n\nMore: Gambling advisory group: End federal ban on sports betting\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2npBblV', 'Sports betting, states\' rights on tap at Supreme Court', 0, 16),

But in a footnote to its unsigned 8-0 opinion, the court called the religious freedom argument and Bessinger\'s other defenses \"patently frivolous.\"\n\nFifty years later, civil rights lawyers are pointing the Supreme Court to Bessinger\'s case in support of Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the gay couple who were turned away by Colorado baker Jack Phillips.\n\nHERE\'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE \'MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP\' CASE\n\n\"The logic of Piggie Park and other precedents overwhelmingly rejecting religious justifications for racial discrimination apply squarely to the context of LGBTQ discrimination,\" the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in a Supreme Court brief, according to SCOTUS Blog. The fund also represented the people who sued Piggie Park.\n\nBoth cases involve laws intended to prevent discrimination by private businesses that open their doors to the public. In the case of Piggie Park, the law was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The bake shop case involves the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits businesses from refusing to sell their goods to people on the basis of sexual orientation among other things.\n\nAs the case has come to the justices, the focus is on Phillips\' speech rights, not his religious beliefs. As a cake artist, he claims a right not to say something with which he disagrees.\n\nPhillips\' lawyers also say the baker\'s issue is not with gay people, but rather same-sex marriage. He will sell any pre-made goods to anyone who walks in the store, lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing Phillips, said. He also would make a cake celebrating \"a marriage between a man and a woman even if one or both spouses identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual,\" his lawyers wrote.\n\nLaws that regulate speech, as Phillips\' team asserts the Colorado anti-discrimination law does, often must withstand the toughest level of review that courts can apply, known as strict scrutiny. His lawyers rely on a 1995 unanimous Supreme Court decision allowing organizers of the St. Patrick\'s Day parade in Boston to exclude a gay rights group from the parade.\n\nSpeech restrictions rarely survive strict scrutiny at the Supreme Court.\n\nBut both Phillips and the Trump administration, which entered the case on Phillips\' side, said speech restrictions aimed at race might be different.\n\nA ruling for the baker would not call into question the use of public accommodations laws to prohibit racial discrimination, the administration said in its Supreme Court brief. \"As the court recently observed, \'racial bias\' is \'a familiar and recurring evil\' that poses \'unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns,\'\" the administration said, quoting from a decision this year in a case about racial discrimination among jurors.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Some see echoes of \'68 court case in wedding cake dispute', -0.2, 10),

It is suing the great state of Michigan, claiming its franchise dealer law prohibiting Tesla from marketing its cars directly to customers in the Wolverine State is prohibited by the US Constitution. While that legal action is wending its way through the courts, SolarCity, the rooftop solar division of Tesla, is also pursuing legal action against the Salt River Project, the utility company that supplies electricity to the Phoenix, Arizona area.\n\nThat suit claims that SLP’s fees assessed against customers with rooftop solar systems are in violation of federal antitrust laws. SLP, not surprisingly, vigorously disputes that allegation. The utility raises an argument that is familiar by now to many of those who follow developments in the field of renewable energy. It says people who put solar panels on their roof get an unfair advantage over other customers because they avoid paying their fair share to maintain the utility grid — all those poles, wires, substations, and transformers that are needed to transmit electricity from where it is normally created to where it is used.\n\nIn 2016, SLP proposed new fees for its customers with rooftop solar systems, fees that were approved by the Arizona Corporations Commission. SolarCity claims those fees add about $600 a year to the bills of customers with rooftop solar systems. It alleges the fees are an illegal attempt to limit competition and are therefore prohibited by antitrust laws.\n\n“Because solar customers are unable to completely disconnect from SRP’s grid — they still need power in the evening hours and at other times when their energy demands exceed what their solar energy systems produce — they cannot escape SRP’s penalty,” lawyers for SolarCity contend. In support of their argument, they point out that the new fees amount to a 65% rate increase for solar companies, compared to a 3.9% increase for non-solar customers. “Customers recognize that SRP’s new pricing plan leaves them with no choice: After the effective date of SRP’s new plan, applications for distributed solar energy systems in SRP’s territory fell by 96 percent,” the lawsuit states.\n\nSLP claims it is not subject to antitrust law because it is a quasi-public corporation whose policies and pricing structure must be approved by state regulators. “We would argue that ours is a statutory pricing process and that the courts have no business setting rates,” claims SRP spokesperson Scott Harelson. SLP lost that argument at the trial court level but appealed. In June, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court. SLP has now appealed that ruling to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court is not required to hear every appeal filed. Litigants only get their cases heard by petitioning for a Writ of Certiorari. The Latin root of “certiorari” is the same as for the word “certain.” Certiorari quite literally is a way for the highest court to make certain that justice was served by a lower court’s ruling. It has total control over which petitions it accepts. Most are denied. Typically, it only takes cases which have significant national implications.\n\nThe SolarCity litigation could have many ramifications for situations in which state boards oversee the operation of businesses that benefit from a government sponsored monopoly. As reported by The Hill, the Supreme Court agreed last week to hear SLP’s appeal, which suggests several members of the Court have reservations about the 9th Circuit’s ruling. Usually, it takes about a year before a case accepted for review gets heard and a decision is handed down.\n\nOne of the mantras of conservatives reactionaries today is that government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the commercial sphere. Yet in practice, that shibboleth is just a smokescreen to allow for the the free and unfettered exercise of naked political power and the US Supreme Court is the most political court in the nation. If SolarCity is successful, it will be responsible for writing new law — just one more way Elon Musk and Tesla are disrupting conventional thinking. But it is likely to get a chilly reception from most of the conservative wing of the Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'US Supreme Court To Hear SolarCity Anti-Trust Case', -0.1, 10.9);

And now, after wending its way through the system, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission is finally having its day before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMany legal experts believe it will be the most significant case of the term. It involves a clash of our rights as citizens, as well as our ideals.\n\nTwo of the most precious rights Americans possess are freedom of expression and freedom to practice their religion as they see fit. Both are enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nBut these rights are not absolute. They sometimes may clash with a duty toward others. Masterpiece Cakeshop will test these limits.\n\nIt began in July 2012, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins asked Jack Phillips, who owned the Masterpiece Cakeshop, to create a custom wedding cake to celebrate their same-sex marriage. Phillips refused, saying he didn’t wish to promote a same-sex wedding due to his religious beliefs.\n\nOne thing is for sure – no matter how it’s decided, the case will be a blockbuster.\n\nCraig and Mullins filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The commission decided against Phillips, declaring he had discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nThe commission ordered Masterpiece Cakeshop to change its policies, give its staff training on discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for two years on steps taken to comply with the order.\n\nThe Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the decision and the Colorado Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Last year, Phillips petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the Colorado ruling violates the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Since then, almost a hundred briefs have been filed by groups around the country, arguing over the numerous potential legal ramifications.\n\nDr. John Eastman, a professor and former dean at Chapman University’s school of law, believes the free speech argument is strong, because Phillips’ work involved “expressive conduct.”\n\n“Whether it’s a photographer, or a cake-maker, or a T-shirt designer,” he notes, “they’re engaged in expressive activity” which is covered by the First Amendment. In fact, in the case of “T-shirts or language on a cake, it’s actual speech.”\n\nBut Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at University of California, Berkeley, counters that the expressive activity comes from the customers. “If I choose the words on my cake, I’m engaging in expression. The baker is simply putting my words on a cake.”\n\nFurther, Chemerinsky notes that “even if this is about speech” that doesn’t mean the government can’t intercede. And in this case, “the interest in preventing discrimination outweighs” other interests. For instance, the baker would lose in court if he were “against interracial marriage and won’t bake a cake for an interracial couple.”\n\nEastman suggests we “shift the facts” and imagine a “white racist who wants an African-American baker to bake a cake celebrating the Ku Klux Klan.” If the courts tried to claim creating the cake “doesn’t implicate free speech rights, people would be howling.” Phillips was willing to serve homosexuals in his shop, but he didn’t want to be forced to support their beliefs.\n\nAs for the related free exercise of religion argument, Chemerinsky says that under the Supreme Court decision Employment Division v. Smith (1990), state law – such as Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws – may limit what people claim is their religious right, as long as the statutes are “neutral laws of general applicability” and not aimed at religion.\n\nEastman agrees that the Smith ruling makes the free exercise argument a tougher sell. But he wonders whether it’s time to revisit the precedent, now that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia – who authored the opinion – has died.\n\nCourt observers believe the decision could go either way. They’ll be watching the newest justice, President Trump’s pick Neil Gorsuch, for signs of how he’ll vote. More importantly, most say, is which way Justice Anthony Kennedy goes. If it’s a close case, it’s generally thought he’ll most likely cast the deciding vote.\n\nOne thing is for sure – no matter how it’s decided, the case will be a blockbuster. Eastman believes this could be bigger than the Hobby Lobby opinion a few years back, which allowed a company an exemption from a contraceptive mandate due to religious objections. That case was limited in scope, but if the Supreme Court finds for Phillips, it could mean there’s a constitutional right that would trump numerous statutes across the nation.', '\'Masterpiece Cakeshop\' is having its day before the US Supreme Court -- Here\'s what we know ...', 0, 13.9),

If everyone\'s a crooked, why not vote for the guy you like anyway?\n\n\"By the time election day is here, they will come to terms with it and hold their nose,\" Browder said, speaking generally and not specifically about the Senate contest.\n\nAlabama may not have quite the lowly reputation of its neighbor Louisiana, but corruption, wrote columnist John Archibald, is \"as Alabama as laundry detergent and toilet paper on a stick,\" referring to the University of Alabama signature tailgating gear.\n\nThree of the state\'s last six governors were convicted or pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including one, Guy Hunt, who used $200,000 in inaugural funds for personal items, including a cow for his farm and a marble shower for his home.

Guy Hunt attends a rally for Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole (not shown) on June 14, 1996, in Birmingham. Dave Martin / AP file\n\nIn 2011, a federal appeals court suggested that the Jefferson County Commission, based in the state\'s largest city of Birmingham, should be added to the dictionary \"as a helpful illustration\" for the word “kleptocracy.”\n\nOver five years, \"five members or former members of the commission that governs Alabama\'s most populous county committed crimes involving their \'service\' in office for which they were later convicted in federal court. And the commission has only five members,\" wrote Judge Ed Carnes on behalf of the 11th Circuit Court.\n\nIn September, Oliver Robinson, a former guard for the San Antonio Spurs who was elected to the Alabama state legislature as a Democrat, pleaded guilty to multiple charges related to a secret deal he cut to fight environmental action on behalf of a coal mining company. He\'ll be sentenced on Thursday.\n\nJeff McLaughlin, a former Democratic state representative who has been dubbed \"the last honest politician in Alabama,\" said voters too often shrug off bad behavior.\n\n\"Obviously they do, or this wouldn\'t be a close race,\" he said of the Senate election pitting Moore against Democrat Doug Jones. \"It\'s mind-boggling to me, Doug Jones ought to be 20 points ahead.\"\n\nWhen McLaughlin arrived at the state Capitol, he said he was shocked to receive three separate offers to essentially launder money through his campaign (legally) in his first two weeks. Later, he was propositioned with an explicit quid pro quo minutes before the vote in question.\n\n\"By that time, I had the reputation for being a bit of a goody two-shoes down there,\" he told NBC News. \"And they still offered me that money.
